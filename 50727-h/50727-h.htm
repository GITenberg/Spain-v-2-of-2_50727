<h2><a name="ARANJUEZ" id="ARANJUEZ"></a>ARANJUEZ.</h2>


<p>As on arriving at Madrid by way of the north, so
on leaving it by way of the south, one must pass
through a desolate country that resembles the poorest
provinces of Arragon and Old Castile. There
are vast plains, parched and yellow, which look as
though they would echo like a hollow passageway if
one were to strike them, or crumble like the crust
of a crisp tart. And through the plains are scattered
a few wretched villages of the same color as
the soil, which seem as though they would take fire
like a pile of dry leaves if one were to touch a torch
to the corner of one of the huts. After an hour of
travel my shoulders sought the cushions of the carriage,
my elbow sought for a support, my head
sought my hand, and I fell into a deep sleep like a
member of Leopardi's "Assembly of Listeners." A
few minutes after I had closed my eyes I was rudely
awakened by a desperate cry from the women and
children, and leaped to my feet, demanding of my
neighbors what had occurred.</p>

<p>But before I had ended my question a general
burst of laughter reassured me. A company of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
huntsmen, scattered over the plain, on noticing the
approach of the train, had planned to give the travellers
a little scare. At that time there was a rumor
that a band of Carlists had appeared in the vicinity
of Aranjuez. The huntsmen, pretending to be the
vanguard of the band, had given a loud shout while
the train was passing, as if to call the great body
of their comrades to their assistance, and as they
shouted they went through the motions of firing at
the railway-carriages; hence arose the fright and
the cries of my fellow-travellers. And then the
huntsmen suddenly threw the butts of their guns
into the air to show that it was all a joke.</p>

<p>When the alarm, in which I too shared for a
moment, had subsided, I fell once more into my
academic doze, but was again awakened in a few
moments in a manner much more pleasant than on
the first occasion.</p>

<p>I looked around: the vast barren plain had been
transformed as by magic into a great garden full of
the most charming groves, traversed in all directions
by wide avenues, dotted with country-houses and
cottages festooned with verdure; here and there the
sparkling of fountains, shady grottoes, flowering
meadows, vineyards, and bridle-paths&mdash;a verdure, a
freshness, a vernal odor, an atmosphere of happiness
and peace, that enchanted the soul. We had arrived
at Aranjuez. I left the train, walked up a
beautiful avenue shaded by two rows of noble trees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
and after a few steps found myself in front of the
royal palace.</p>

<p>The minister Castelar had written in his memorandum
a few days before that the fall of the ancient
Spanish monarchy was predoomed on that day when
a mob of the populace, with curses on their lips and
hatred in their hearts, had invaded the palace of
Aranjuez to disturb the majestic repose of their sovereigns.
I had reached that square where on the 17th
of March, 1808, occurred those events which were
the prologue of the national war, and, as it were,
the first word of the death-sentence of the ancient
monarchy. My eyes quickly sought the windows of
the apartments of the Prince of Peace; I imagined
him, as he fled from room to room, pale and distracted,
searching for a hiding-place as the echo of
the cry followed him up the stairs; I saw poor
Charles IV., as with trembling hands he placed the
crown of Spain on the head of the prince of the
Asturias; all the scenes of that terrible drama were
enacted in fancy before my eyes, and the profound
silence of the place and the sight of that palace,
closed and desolate, sent a chill to my heart.</p>

<p>The palace has the appearance of a castle: it is
built of brick, with trimmings of light stone, and
covered with a tile roof. Every one knows that it
was built for Philip II. by the celebrated architect
Herrera, and that it was adorned by all the later
kings, who made it their summer residence. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
enter: the interior is magnificent; there is the stupendous
reception-hall of the ambassadors, the beautiful
Chinese cabinet belonging to Charles V., the
marvellous dressing-chamber of Isabella II., and a
profusion of the most precious ornaments. But all
the riches of the palace are as nothing to the beauty
of the gardens. The expectation is not disappointed.</p>

<p>The gardens of Aranjuez (Aranjuez is the name
of a little town which lies a short distance from the
palace) seem to have been laid out for a race of
Titan kings, to whom the royal parks and gardens
of our country would have seemed like the flower-beds
on their terraces or the plots before their
stables. Endless avenues, bordered by trees of
measureless height with arched branches interlacing
as if bent toward each other by contrary winds, extend
in every direction like a forest whose boundaries
one cannot see, and through this forest the
Tagus, a wide, swift stream, flows in a majestic
curve, forming here and there cascades and lakes:
an abundant and luxuriant vegetation springs up
amid a labyrinth of bypaths, crossways, and sylvan
glades; and in every part gleam statues, vases,
columns, and fountains rising to a great height and
falling in spray, festoons, and drops of water, placed
in the midst of all manner of flowers from Europe
and America; and, mingling with the majestic roar
of the cascades of the Tagus, a flood of song from
innumerable nightingales, which make the mys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>terious
gloom of the lonely paths ring with their
mellow notes. In the depths of the gardens rises
a small marble palace of modest proportions which
contains all the wonders of the most magnificent
royal abode; and here one may still breathe, so to
speak, the air of the inmost life of the kings of
Spain. Here are the small secret chambers whose
ceilings one may touch with the hand, the billiard-room
of Charles IV., his cue, the cushions embroidered
by the hands of his queens, the musical
clocks which enlivened the playtime of his children,
the narrow staircases, the little windows about which
cluster a hundred traditions of princely caprices,
and, finally, the richest retiring-room in Europe,
created at a whim of Charles V., containing in itself
alone sufficient riches to adorn a palace, without
depriving it of the noble primacy which it proudly
holds among all other cabinets designed for the same
use. Beyond this palace and all around the groves
extend vineyards and olive-groves and orchards of
fruit-bearing trees and smiling meadows. It is a
veritable oasis in the midst of the desert&mdash;an oasis
which Philip II. chose to create on a day when he
was in good humor, as if to enliven with one cheerful
image the black melancholy of the Escurial. On
returning from the little marble palace toward the
great royal palace through those endless avenues, in
the shade of those noble trees, in that profound
forest silence, I thought of the splendid trains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
ladies and cavaliers who once wandered about in the
footsteps of the gay young monarchs or the capricious
and dissolute queens to the sound of amorous music
and songs which told of the grandeur and glory of
unconquered Spain; and I sadly repeated with the
poet, Ricanati,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">... "All is peace and silence,</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">And their names are no longer heard."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But as I looked at those marble seats, half hidden
in the shrubbery, and fixed my eyes on the shadow
of certain distant paths, and thought of those queens,
those lovers, and those mad pranks, I could not
refrain from a sigh, which was not one of pity, and
a secret sense of bitterness stung me to the heart;
and I said, like poor Adan in the poem <i>Diablo
Mundo</i>, "How are these grand ladies made? How
do they live? What do they do? Do they talk,
make love, and enjoy like us?" And I left for
Toledo, imagining the love of a queen like a young
adventurer of the Arabian Nights.</p>

<h2><a name="TOLEDO" id="TOLEDO"></a>TOLEDO.</h2>


<p>When one approaches an unknown city one ought
to have near by some one who has already seen it
and is able to indicate the opportune moment to put
one's head out of the window and get the first view.
I had the good fortune to be informed in time.
Some one said to me, "There is Toledo!" and I
sprang to the window with an exclamation of
wonder.</p>

<p>Toledo rises on a sheer rocky height, at whose
foot the Tagus describes a grand curve. From the
plain one sees only the rocks and the walls of the
fortress, and beyond the wall the tips of the belfries
and the towers. The houses are hidden from view;
the city seems to be closed and inaccessible, and
presents the appearance of an abandoned stronghold
rather than of a city. From the walls to the river-banks
there is not a single house nor tree; all is
bare, parched, craggy, precipitous; not a soul is in
sight; you would say that to make the ascent it
would be necessary to climb, and it seems that at
the first appearance of a man on the face of those
rocks a shower of arrows would fall upon him from
the top of the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>You leave the train, get into a carriage, and
arrive at the entrance of a bridge. It is the famous
bridge Alcantara, which spans the Tagus, surmounted
by a beautiful Moorish gate in the form of
a tower, which gives it a bold, severe appearance.
Crossing the bridge, you turn into a wide roadway
which winds up in large serpentine curves until it
reaches the top of the mountain. Here it really
seems that you are under a fortified city of the
Middle Ages, and you imagine yourself in the guise
of a Moor or a Goth or a soldier of Alfonso VI.
From every part precipitous rocks hang over your
head, crumbling walls, towers, and the ruins of
ancient bastions, and higher up the last wall which
encircles the city, black, crowned with enormous
battlements, opened here and there by great
breaches, behind which the imprisoned houses rear
their heads; and as you climb higher and higher the
city seems to draw back and hide itself. Halfway
up the ascent you come to the <i>Puerto del Sol</i>, a
jewel of Moorish architecture, consisting of two
embattled towers which are joined over a very graceful
double-arched colonnade, under which runs the
ancient street; and from that point, if you look
back, you may see at a glance the Tagus, the valley,
and the hills. You go on and find other walls and
other ruins, and finally the first houses of the city.</p>

<p>What a city! At the first moment I caught my
breath. The carriage had turned down a little
street, so narrow that the hubs of the wheels almost
touched the walls of the houses.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><i><a id="Gate_of_the_Sun"></a>Gate of the Sun, Toledo</i></div>

<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b018c.jpg" alt="" /></div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>"Why do you turn in here?" I asked the driver.</p>

<p>He laughed and answered, "Because there is no
wider street."</p>

<p>"Is all Toledo like this?" I asked again.</p>

<p>"It is all like this," he replied</p>

<p>"Impossible!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You will see," he added.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I did not believe him. I entered
a hotel, dropped my valise in a room, and ran headlong
down the stairs to take a look at this very
strange city. One of the hotel-porters stopped me
at the door and asked with a smile,</p>

<p>"Where are you going, <i>caballero</i>?"</p>

<p>"To see Toledo," I replied.</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes; why not?"</p>

<p>"But have you ever been here before?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Then you cannot go alone."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because you will get lost."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you go out."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"The reason is this," he answered, pointing to a
wall on which hung a map of Toledo. I approached
and saw a network of white lines on a black back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>ground
that seemed like one of those flourishes
which school-boys make on their slates to waste the
chalk and vex their teacher.</p>

<p>"No matter," said I; "I am going alone, and if
I get lost, let them come and find me."</p>

<p>"You will not go a hundred steps," observed the
porter.</p>

<p>I went out and turned down the first street I saw,
so narrow that on extending my arms I touched both
walls. After fifty paces I turned into another street,
narrower than the first, and from this passed into a
third, and so on.</p>

<p>I seemed to be wandering not through the streets
of the city, but through the corridors of a building,
and I went forward, expecting momentarily to come
out into an open place. It is impossible, I thought,
that the whole city is built in this manner; no one
could live in it. But as I proceeded the streets
seemed to grow narrower and shorter; every
moment I was obliged to turn; after a curving
street came a zigzag one, and after this another in
the form of a hook, which led me back into the
first, and so I wandered on for a little while, always
in the midst of the same houses. Now and then I
came out at a crossway where several alleys ran off
in opposite directions, one of which would lose itself
in the dark shadow of a portico, another would end
blindly in a few paces against the wall of a house,
a third in a short distance would descend, as it were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
into the bowels of the earth, while a fourth would
clamber up a steep hill; some were hardly wide
enough to give a man passage; others were confined
between two walls without doors or windows; and
all were flanked by buildings of great height, between
whose roofs one could see a narrow streak
of sky.</p>

<p>One passed windows defended by heavy iron bars,
great doors studded with enormous nails, and dark
courtyards. I walked for some time without meeting
anybody, until I came out into one of the principal
streets, lined with shops and full of peasants,
women, and children, but little larger than an ordinary
corridor. Everything is in proportion to the
streets: the doors are like windows, the shops like
niches, and by glancing into them one sees all the
secrets of the house&mdash;the table already spread, the
babies in the cradle, the mother combing her hair,
and the father changing his shirt; everything is on
the street, and it does not seem like a city, but like
a house containing a single great family.</p>

<p>I turned into a less-frequented street, where I
heard only the buzzing of a fly; my footsteps
echoed to the fourth story of the houses and brought
some old women to the windows. A horse passes;
it seems like a squadron; everybody hurries to
see what is going on. The least sound re-echoes in
every direction; a book falls in a second story,
an old man coughs in a courtyard, a woman blows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
her nose in some unknown place; one hears
everything.</p>

<p>Sometimes every sound will suddenly cease; you
are alone, you see no sign of life: you seem to be
surrounded by the houses of witches, crossways
made for conspirators, blind alleys for traitors, narrow
doorways suitable for any crime, windows for the
whispers of guilty lovers, gloomy doorways suggestive
of blood-stained steps. But yet in all this labyrinth
of streets there are no two alike; each one
has its individuality: here rises an arch, there a
column, yonder a piece of statuary. Toledo is a
storehouse of art-treasures. Every little while the
walls crumble, and there are revealed in every part
records of all the centuries&mdash;bas-reliefs, arabesques,
Moorish windows, and statuettes. The palaces have
doorways defended by plates of engraved metal, historical
knockers, nails with carved heads, 'scutcheons
and emblems; and they form a fine contrast to the
modern houses painted with festoons, medallions,
cupids, urns, and fantastic animals.</p>

<p>But these embellishments detract in no way from
the severe and gloomy aspect of Toledo. Wherever
you look you see something to remind you of the
city fortified by the Arabs; however little your imagination
may exert itself, it will succeed in rearranging
from the relics scattered here and there the
whole fabric of that darkened image, and then the
illusion is complete: you see again the glorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Toledo of the Middle Ages, and forget the solitude
and silence of its streets. But it is a fleeting illusion,
and you soon relapse into sad meditation and
see only the skeleton of the ancient city, the necropolis
of three empires, the great sepulchre of the
glory of three races. Toledo reminds you of the
dreams which come to young men after reading the
romantic legends of the Middle Ages. You have
seen many a time in your dreams dark cities encircled
by deep moats, frowning walls, and inaccessible
rocks; and you have crossed those draw-bridges
and entered those tortuous, grass-grown
streets, and have breathed that damp, sepulchral,
prison air. Well, then, you have dreamed of
Toledo.</p>

<p>The first thing to see, after making a general survey
of the city, is the cathedral, which is justly considered
one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the
world. The history of this cathedral, according to
popular tradition, dates from the times of the apostle
Saint James, first bishop of Toledo, who selected the
place where it should be erected; but the construction
of the edifice as it appears to-day was begun in
1227, during the reign of San Fernando, and was
ended after twenty-five years of almost continuous
labor. The exterior of this immense church is
neither rich nor beautiful, as is that of the cathedral
of Burgos. A little square extends in front of the
faÃ§ade, and is the only place from which one can get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
a view of any considerable part of the building. It
is entirely surrounded by a narrow street, from
which, however much you may twist your neck, you
can see only the high outer walls which enclose the
church like a fortress. The faÃ§ade has three great
doorways, the first of which is named <i>Pardon</i>, the
second <i>Inferno</i>, and the third <i>Justice</i>. Over it rises
a substantial tower which terminates in a beautiful
octagonal cupola. Although in walking around the
building one may have remarked its great size, on
first entering one is struck by a profound sense of
wonder, which quickly gives place to another keen
sense of pleasure, the result of the freshness, the
repose, the soft shadow, and the mysterious light
which steals through the stained glass of innumerable
windows and breaks in a thousand rays of blue,
golden, and rosy light which glides here and there
along the arches and columns like the bands of a
rainbow. The church is formed of five great naves
divided by eighty-eight enormous pilasters, each of
which is composed of sixteen turned columns as
close together as a bunch of spears. A sixth nave
cuts the other five at right angles, extending from
the great altar to the choir, and the vaulted roof of
this principal nave rises majestically above the
others, which seem to be bowing to it as if in
homage. The many-colored light and the clear
tone of the stone give the church an air of quiet
cheerfulness which tempers the melancholy appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>ance
of the Gothic architecture without depriving it
of its austere and serious character. To pass from
the streets of the city to the naves of this cathedral
seems like coming out of a dungeon into an open
square: one looks around, draws a deep breath, and
begins to live again.</p>

<p>The high altar, if one wished to examine it minutely,
would require as much time as the interior
of a church: it is itself a church&mdash;a miracle of little
columns, statuettes, traceries, and ornaments of endless
variety, creeping along the iron frames, rising
above the architraves, winding about the niches,
supporting one another, climbing and disappearing,
presenting on every side a thousand outlines, groups,
combinations, effects in gilding and color, every sort
of grace that art can devise&mdash;giving to the whole an
effect of magnificence, dignity, and beauty. Opposite
the high altar rises the choir, divided into three
orders of stalls, marvellously carved by Philip of
Bourgogne and Berruguete, with bas-reliefs representing
historical events, allegories, and sacred legends&mdash;one
of the most famous monuments of
art.</p>

<p>In the centre, in the form of a throne, stands the
seat of the archbishop surrounded by a circle of
enormous jasper columns, with colossal statues of
alabaster resting on the architraves; on either side
rise enormous bronze pulpits provided with two
great missals, and two gigantic organs, one in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
of the other, from which it seems that at any moment
a flood of melody may burst forth and make the
vault tremble.</p>

<p>The pleasure of one's admiration in these great
cathedrals is almost always disturbed by importunate
guides, who wish at any cost to amuse you after
their fashion. And it was my misfortune to become
convinced that the Spanish guides are the most persistent
of their kind. When one of them has gotten
it into his head that you are to spend the day with
him, it is all over. You may shrug your shoulders,
refuse to notice him, let him talk himself hoarse
without so much as turning to look at him, wander
about on your own account as though you had not
seen him: it is all the same thing. In a moment of
enthusiasm before some painting or statue a word
escapes you, a gesture, a smile: it is enough. You
are caught, you are his, you are the prey of this
implacable human cuttle-fish, who, like the cuttle-fish
of Victor Hugo, does not leave his victim until
he has cut off his head. While I stood contemplating
the statuary of the choir I saw one of these
cuttle-fish out of the corner of my eye&mdash;a miserable
old rake, who approached me with slow steps sidewise,
like a cutthroat with the air of one who was
saying, "Now I have got you!" I continued to look
at the statues; the old man came up to my side, and
he too began to look; then he suddenly asked me,
"Do you wish my company?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>"No," I replied, "I don't need you."</p>

<p>And he continued, without any embarrassment,</p>

<p>"Do you know who Elpidius was?"</p>

<p>The question was so remarkable that I could not
keep from asking in my turn,</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Elpidius," he replied, "was the second bishop
of Toledo."</p>

<p>"Well, what of him?</p>

<p>"'What of him?' It was the bishop Elpidius
who conceived the idea of consecrating the church
to the Virgin, and that is the reason why the Virgin
came to visit the church."</p>

<p>"Ah! how do you know that?"</p>

<p>"How do you know it? You see it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that it has been seen?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say that it is still to be seen: have
the goodness to come with me."</p>

<p>So saying, he started off, and I followed him,
very curious to learn what this visible form of the
descent of the Virgin might be. We stopped in
front of a sort of chapel close to one of the great
pilasters of the central nave. The guide pointed
out a white stone set in the wall covered by
an iron net, and with this inscription running
around it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Quando la reina del cielo</div>
  <div class="verse">Puso los pies en el suelo,</div>
  <div class="verse">En esta piedra los puso."</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"When the Queen of heaven</div>
  <div class="verse">Descended to the earth,</div>
  <div class="verse">Her feet rested on this stone."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Then the Holy Virgin has actually placed her
feet on this stone?" I asked.</p>

<p>"On this very stone," he replied; and, thrusting
a finger between the strands of the iron net, he
touched the stone, kissed his finger, made the sign
of the cross, and turned toward me as if to say,
"Now it is your turn."</p>

<p>"My turn?" I replied. "Oh, really, my friend,
I cannot do it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I do not feel myself worthy to touch
that sacred stone."</p>

<p>The guide understood, and, looking hard at me
with a serious aspect, he asked, "You do not
believe?"</p>

<p>I looked at a pilaster. Then the old man made
a sign for me to follow, and started toward a corner
of the church, murmuring with an air of sadness,
"<i>Cadanno es dueÃ±o de su alma</i>" (Every man is
master of his soul).</p>

<p>A young priest who was standing near, and who
had divined the cause of his words, cast a piercing
glance at me, and went off in an opposite direction,
muttering I know not what.</p>

<p>The chapels correspond in style with that of the
church: almost all of them contain some fine monu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>ments.
In the chapel of Santiago, behind the high
altar, are two magnificent tombs of alabaster which
contain the remains of the constable Alvaro de Luna
and his wife; in the chapel of San Ildefonso, the
tomb of the cardinal Gil Carrillo de Albornoz; in
the chapel of the "New Kings," the tombs of Henry
II., John II., and Henry III.; in the chapel of the
sacristy, a stupendous group of statues and busts
of marble, silver, ivory, and gold, and a collection of
crosses and relics of inestimable value, the remains
of Saint Leucadia and Saint Eugenia preserved in
two silver caskets exquisitely chased.</p>

<p>The Chapel Mozarabe, which is under the tower
of the church, and was erected to perpetuate the
tradition of the primitive Christian rite, is probably
the most worthy of attention. One of its walls is
entirely covered with a fresco, in the Gothic style,
representing a conflict between the Moors and the
Toledans&mdash;marvellously preserved, even to the most
delicate lines. It is a painting worth a volume of
history. In it one sees the Toledo of those times
with all its walls and its houses; the habiliments
of the two armies; the arms, faces, everything portrayed
with an admirable finish and an unspeakable
harmony of color which answers perfectly to the
vague and fantastic idea which one may have formed
of those centuries and those races. Two other frescoes
on either side of the first represent the fleet
which bore the Arabs into Spain, and they offer a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
thousand minute details of the mediÃ¦val marine and
the very air of those times, if one may so speak,
which makes one think of and see a thousand things
not represented in the painting, as one hears distant
music on looking at a landscape.</p>

<p>After the chapels one goes to see the sacristy,
where are gathered enough riches to restore the
finances of Spain to a sound basis. There is, among
others, a vast room on the ceiling of which one sees
a fresco by Luca Giordano, which represents a vision
of paradise, with a myriad of angels, saints, and
allegorical figures floating in the air or standing out
like statues from the cornices of the walls in a thousand
bold attitudes, with so much action and foreshortening
that one is bewildered. The guide,
pointing out this miracle of imagination and genius,
which in the estimation of all artists, to use a very
curious Spanish expression, is a work of <i>merito atroz</i>
(of atrocious merit),&mdash;the guide bids you to look attentively
at the ray of light which falls upon the
walls from the centre of the vaulted ceiling. You
look at it and then make a circuit of the room, and
wherever you find yourself that ray of light is falling
directly upon your head.</p>

<p>From this hall you pass into a room which is also
beautifully painted in fresco by the nephew of
Berruguete, and from it into a third, where a sacristan
lays the treasures of the cathedral before
your eyes&mdash;the enormous silver candlesticks; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
pyxes flashing with rubies; the golden stands for the
elevation of the Host, studded with diamonds; the
damask vestments, embroidered in gold; the robes
of the Virgin, covered with arabesques, garlands of
flowers, and stars of pearl, which at every motion
of the cloth flash forth in a thousand rays and colors
and quite dazzle one's eyes. A hour is scarcely sufficient
to see hurriedly all that display of treasures,
which would certainly satisfy the ambition of ten
queens and enrich the altars of ten cathedrals; and
when, after he has shown you everything, the sacristan
looks in your eyes for an expression of surprise,
he finds only astonishment and stupefaction,
which give evidence of an imagination wandering
in far distant regions&mdash;in the realms of the Arabian
legends where the kindly genii gather all the riches
dreamed of by the glowing fancy of enamored
sultans.</p>

<p>It was the eve of <i>Corpus Domini</i>, and in the sacristy
they were preparing the robes for the processional.
Nothing can be more unpleasant or more at
variance with the quiet and noble sadness of the
church than the theatrical hurry-scurry which one
sees on such occasions. It is like being behind the
scenes on the evening of a dress rehearsal. From one
room of the sacristy to another half-dressed boys
were coming and going with a great clatter, carrying
armfuls of surplices, stoles, and capes; here a sour-tempered
sacristan was opening and banging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
doors of a wardrobe; there a priest, all red in the
face, was calling angrily to a chorister who did not
hear him; yonder other priests were running through
the room with their robes partly on their backs and
partly trailing behind them; some laughing, some
screaming, and some shouting from one room to
another at the top of their voices; everywhere one
heard a swish of skirts, a breathless panting, and an
indescribable stamping and tramping.</p>

<p>I went to see the cloister, but, as the door was
open through which one reaches it from the church,
I saw it before entering. From the middle of the
church one gets a glimpse of a part of the cloister-garden,
a group of fine leafy trees, a little grove, a
mass of luxuriant plants which seem to close the
doorway and look as though they are framed beneath
a graceful arch and between the two slender columns
of the portico which extends all around. It is a
beautiful sight, which makes one think of Oriental
gardens encircled by the columns of a mosque. The
cloister, which is very large, is surrounded by a colonnade,
graceful, though severe in form; the walls
covered with great frescoes. The guide advised me
to rest here a little while before ascending to the
campanile. I leaned against a low wall in the shade
of a tree, and remained there until I felt able to
make another expedition, as the expression is.
Meanwhile, my commander extolled in bombastic
language the glories of Toledo, carrying his impu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>dence
so far, in his patriotism, as to call it "a great
commercial city" which could buy and sell Barcelona
and Valencia, and a city strong enough, if need be,
to withstand ten German armies and a thousand batteries
of Krupp guns. After each of his exaggerations
I kept spurring him on, and the good man enjoyed
himself to the full. What pleasure there is in
knowing how to make others talk! Finally, when
the proud Toledan was so swollen with glory that
the cloister could no longer hold him, he said to me,
"We may go now," and led the way toward the
door of the campanile.</p>

<p>When we were halfway up we stopped to take
breath. The guide knocked at a little door, and out
came a swaggering little sacristan, who opened
another door, and made me enter a corridor where I
saw a collection of gigantic puppets in very strange
attire. Four of them, the guide told me, represented
Europe, Asia, America, and Africa, and two others
Faith and Religion; and they were so made that a
man could hide in them and raise them from the
ground.</p>

<p>"They take them out on the occasions of the
royal fÃªtes," the sacristan added, "and carry them
around through the city;" and, to show me how it
was done, he crept in under the robes of Asia.
Then he led me to a corner where there was an
enormous monster which when touched, I know not
where, stretched out a very long neck and a horrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
head and made a dreadful noise. But he could not
tell me what this ugly creature signified, and so
invited me instead to admire the marvellous imagination
of the Spaniards, which creates so "many new
things" to sell in all the known world. I admired,
paid, and continued the ascent with my Toledan
cuttle-fish. From the top of the tower one enjoys
a splendid view&mdash;the city, the hills, the river, a vast
horizon, and, below, the great mass of the cathedral,
which seems like a mountain of granite. But there
is another elevation, a short distance away, from
which one sees everything to a better advantage,
and consequently I remained in the campanile only
a few moments, especially as at that hour the sun
was shining very strongly, confusing all the colors
of the city and country in a flood of light.</p>

<p>From the cathedral my guide led me to see the
famous church of <i>San Juan de los Reyes</i>, situated on
the banks of the Tagus. My mind is still confused
when I think of the windings and turnings which we
were obliged to make in order to reach it. It was
mid-day, the streets were deserted; gradually, as
we went farther from the centre of the city, the
solitude became more depressing; not a door or
window was open, not the slightest sound was heard.
For a moment I suspected that the guide was in
league with some assassin to entice me into an
out-of-the-way place and rob me; he had a suspicious
face, and then he kept glancing here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
there with a suspicious air, like one meditating a
crime.</p>

<p>"Is it much farther?" I would ask from time to
time, and he would always answer: "It is right
here," and yet we never reached it.</p>

<p>At a certain point my uneasiness changed into
fear: in a narrow, tortuous street a door opened;
two bearded men came out, made a sign to the
cuttle-fish, and fell in behind us. I thought it was
all over with me. There was only one way of
escape&mdash;to strike the guide, knock him down, jump
over his body, and run. But which way? And on
the other side there came into my mind the high
praises which Thiers bestows on the "Spanish legs"
in his <i>History of the War of Independence</i>; and I
thought that flight would only prove an opportunity
to plant a dagger in my back instead of my stomach,
Alas! to die without seeing Andalusia! To die after
taking so many notes, after giving so many tips&mdash;to
die with pockets full of letters of introduction, with
a purse fat with doubloons&mdash;to die with a passport
covered with seals&mdash;to die by treachery! As God
willed, the two bearded men disappeared at the first
corner and I was saved. Then, overwhelmed by
compunction for suspecting that the poor old man
could be capable of a crime, I came over to his left
side, offered him a cigar, said that Toledo was worth
two Romes, and showed him a thousand courtesies.
Finally we arrived at <i>San Juan de los Reyes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>It is a church which seems like a royal palace:
the highest part is covered by a balcony surrounded
with a honeycombed and sculptured breastwork,
upon which rises a series of statues of kings, and
in the middle stands a graceful hexagonal cupola
which completes the beautiful harmony of the edifice.
From the walls hang long iron chains which
were suspended there by the Christian prisoners
released at the conquest of Granada, and which,
together with the dark color of the stone, give the
church a severe and picturesque appearance. We
entered, passed through two or three large, bare
rooms, unpaved, cluttered with piles of dirt and
heaps of rubbish, climbed a staircase, and came out
upon a high gallery inside the church, which is one
of the most beautiful and noblest of the monuments
of Gothic architecture. It has a single great nave
divided into four vaults, whose arches intersect
under rich rosettes. The pilasters are covered with
festoons and arabesques; the walls ornamented with
a profusion of bas-reliefs, with enormous shields
bearing the arms of Castile and Arragon, eagles,
dragons, heraldic animals, trailing vines, and emblematic
inscriptions; the gallery running all around the
room is perforated and carved with great elegance;
the choir is supported by a bold arch; the color of
the stone is light gray, and everything is admirably
finished and preserved, as if the church had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
built but a few years ago, instead of at the end of
the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>From the church we descended to the cloister,
which is, in truth, a miracle of architecture and
sculpture. Graceful slender columns which could
be broken in two by the stroke of a hammer, looking
like the trunks of saplings, support capitals
richly adorned like curving boughs; arches ornamented
with flowers, birds, and grotesque animals in
every sort of carving. The walls are covered with
inscriptions in Gothic characters in a framework of
leaves and very delicate arabesques. Wherever one
looks one finds grace mingled with riches in enchanting
harmony: it would not be possible to accumulate
in an equal space and with more exquisite art a
larger number of the most delicate and beautiful
objects. It is a luxuriant garden of sculpture, a
grand saloon embroidered, quilted, and brocaded in
marble, a great monument, majestic as a temple,
magnificent as a palace, delicate as a toy, and graceful
as a flower.</p>

<p>After the cloisters one goes to see a picture-gallery
which contains only some paintings of little value,
and then to the convent with its long corridors, its
narrow stairs, and empty cells, almost on the point
of falling into ruins, and in some parts already in
ruins; throughout bare and squalid like a building
gutted by fire.</p>

<p>A little way from <i>San Juan de los Reyes</i> there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
another monument well worthy of attention, a curious
record of the Judaic period&mdash;the synagogue
now known by the name of Santa Maria la Blanca.
One enters an untidy garden and knocks at the door
of a wretched-looking house. The door opens.
There is a delightful sense of surprise, a vision of
the Orient, a sudden revelation of another religion
and another world. There are five narrow alleys
divided by four long rows of little octagonal pilasters,
which support as many Moorish arches with
stucco capitals of various forms; the ceiling is of
cedar-wood divided into squares, and here and there
on the walls are arabesques and Arabic inscriptions.
The light falls from above, and everything is white.
The synagogue was converted into a mosque by the
Arabs, and the mosque into a church by the Christians,
so that, properly, it is none of the three,
although it still preserves the character of the
mosque, and the eye surveys it with delight, and
the imagination follows from arch to arch the fleeting
images of a sensuous paradise.</p>

<p>When I had seen Santa Maria la Blanca, I had
not the strength to see anything else, and, refusing
all the tempting propositions of the guide, I told him
to lead me back to the hotel. After a long walk
through a labyrinth of narrow, deserted streets we
arrived there; I put a <i>peseta</i> and a half in the hand
of my innocent assassin, who found the fee too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
small, and asked (how I laughed at the word!) for a
little <i>gratificacion</i>.</p>

<p>I went into the dining-room to eat a chop or <i>chuleta</i>
(which is pronounced <i>cuileta</i>), as the Spanish call it&mdash;a
name at which they would turn up their noses in
some of the provinces of Italy.</p>

<p>Toward evening I went to see the Alcazar. The
name raises expectations of a Moorish palace, but
there is nothing Moorish about it except the name.
The building which one admires to-day was built
in the reign of Charles V. on the ruins of a castle
which was in existence as early as the eighth century,
although the notices of it in contemporary chronicles
are vague. This edifice rises upon a height overlooking
the city, so that one sees its walls and towers
from every point above the level of the streets, and
the foreigner finds it a sure landmark amid the confusion
and labyrinths of the city. I climbed the
height by a broad winding street, like that one
which runs from the plain up to the city, and found
myself in front of the Alcazar. It is an immense
square palace, at whose corners rise four great
towers that give it the formidable appearance of a
fortress. A vast square extends in front of the
faÃ§ade, and all around it runs a chain of embattled
bulwarks of Oriental design. The entire building is
of a decided chalky color, relieved by a thousand
varied shades of that powerful painter of monuments,
the burning sun of the South, and it appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
even lighter against the very clear sky upon which
the majestic form of the building is outlined.</p>

<p>The faÃ§ade is carved in arabesques in a manner at
once dignified and elegant. The interior of the
palace corresponds with the exterior: it is a vast
court surrounded by two orders of graceful arches,
one above the other, supported by slender columns,
with a monumental marble staircase starting at the
centre of the side opposite the door, and a little
way above the pavement divides into two parts that
lead to the interior of the palace, the one on the
right, the other on the left. To enjoy the beauty of
the courtyard it is necessary to stand on the landing
where the staircase separates: from that point one
comprehends at a glance the complete harmony of
the edifice, which inspires a sense of cheerfulness
and pleasure, like fine music performed by hidden
musicians.</p>

<p>Excepting the courtyard, the other parts of the
building&mdash;the stairways, the rooms, the corridors&mdash;everything
is in ruins or falling to ruins. They
were at work turning the palace into a military
school, whitewashing the walls, breaking down the
partitions to make great dormitories, numbering the
doors, and converting the palace into a barracks.
Nevertheless, they left intact the great subterranean
chambers which were used for stables at the time of
Charles V., and which are still able to hold several
thousand horses. The guide made me approach a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
window from which I looked down into an abyss that
gave me an idea of their vastness. Then we climbed
a series of unsteady steps into one of the four towers;
the guide opened with pincers and a hammer a window
that had been nailed fast, and with the air of
one who was announcing a miracle said to me,
"Look, sir!"</p>

<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b040cs.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p>It was a wonderful panorama. One had a bird's-eye
view of the city of Toledo, street by street and
house by house, as if one were looking at a map
spread upon a table: here the cathedral, rising above
the city like a measureless castle, and making all
the buildings around it seem as small as toy houses;
there the balcony of <i>San Juan de las Reyes</i>, crowned
with statues; yonder the embattled towers of the
New Gate, the circus, the Tagus running at the foot
of the city between its rocky banks; and beyond
the river, opposite the bridge of Alcantara, on a
precipitous crag, the ruins of the ancient castle of
San Servando; still farther off a verdant plain, and
then rocks, hills, and mountains as far as the eye can
see; and over all a very clear sky and the setting
sun, which gilded the summits of the old buildings
and flashed on the river like a great silver scarf.</p>

<p>While I was contemplating this magic spectacle
the guide, who had read the <i>History of Toledo</i> and
wished me to know the fact, was telling all sorts of
stories with that manner, half poetical and half
facetious, which is distinctive of the Spaniards of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the South. Above all, he wished to explain the history
of the work of fortification, and although, where
he said that he saw clear and unmistakable remains
which he pointed out to me, I saw nothing at all, I
succeeded, nevertheless, in learning something about
it.</p>

<p>He told me that Toledo had been thrice surrounded
by a wall, and that the traces of all three walls were
still clear. "Look!" he said; "follow the line
which my finger indicates: that is the Roman wall,
the innermost one, and its ruins are still visible.
Now look a little farther on: that other one beyond
it is the Gothic wall. Now let your glance describe
a curve which embraces the first two: that is the
Moorish wall, the most recent. But the Moors also
built an inner wall on the ruins of the Roman wall:
this you can easily see. Then observe the direction
of the streets, which converge toward the highest
point of the city; follow the line of the roofs&mdash;here,
so; you will see that all the streets go up zigzag,
and they were built purposely in this manner, so that
the city could be defended even after the walls had
been destroyed; and the houses were built so close
one against another in order that it would be possible
to jump from roof to roof, you see; and then the
Arabs have left it in their writings. This is the
reason that the Spanish gentlemen from Madrid
make me laugh when they come here and say,
'Pooh! what streets!' You see, they do not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
a particle of history: if they knew the least bit, if
they read a little instead of spending their days on
the Prado and in the Recoleto, they would understand
that there is a reason for the narrow streets
of Toledo, and that Toledo is not a city for ignoramuses."</p>

<p>I began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Do you not believe?" continued the custodian:
"it is a sacred fact. Not a week ago, to cite a
case, here comes a dandy from Madrid with his wife.
Well, even as they were climbing the stairs they
began to run down the city, the narrow streets, and
the dark houses. When they came to this window
and saw those two old towers down yonder on the
plain on the left bank of the Tagus, they asked me
what they were, and I answered, '<i>Los palacios de
Galiana</i>.' 'Oh! what beautiful palaces!' they exclaimed,
and began to laugh and looked in another
direction. Why? Because they did not know their
history. Now, I imagine that you do not know any
better; but you are a stranger, and that makes a
difference. Know, then, that the great emperor
Charlemagne came to Toledo when he was a very
young man. King Galafro was reigning then, and
dwelt in that palace. King Galafro had a daughter
Galiana, as beautiful as an angel; and, as Charlemagne
was a guest of the king and saw the princess
every day, he fell in love with her with all his heart,
and so did the princess with him. But there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
rival between them, and this rival was the king of
Guadalajara, a Moorish giant of herculean strength
and the courage of a lion. This king, to see the
princess without being seen, had a subterranean
passage made all the way from the city of Guadalajara
to the very foundation of the palace. But
what good did it do? The princess could not even
bear to see him, and as often as he came, so often
did he return crestfallen; but not for this did the
enamored king stop paying his court. And so much
did he come hanging around that Charlemagne, who
was not a man to be imposed upon, as you can
imagine, lost his patience, and to end the matter
challenged him. They fought: it was a terrible
struggle, but the Moor, for all he was a giant, got
the worst of it. When he was dead Charlemagne
cut off his head and laid it at the feet of his love,
who approved the delicacy of his offering, became a
Christian, gave her hand to the prince, and went
away with him to France, where she was proclaimed
empress."</p>

<p>"And the head of the Moor?"</p>

<p>"You may laugh, but these are sacred facts.
Do you see that old building down there at the
highest point of the city? It is the church of San
GinÃ©s. And do you know what is inside of it?
Nothing less than the door of an underground
passage which extends three leagues beyond Toledo.
You do not believe it? Listen! At the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
where the church of San GinÃ©s now stands there
once was an enchanted palace before the Moors
invaded Spain. No king had ever had the courage
to enter it, and those who might possibly have been
so bold did not do it because, according to the tradition,
the first man who crossed that threshold
would be the ruin of Spain. Finally King Roderic,
before setting out for the battle of Guadalete, hoping
to find in it some treasures which would furnish
him means to resist the invasion of the Moors, had
the doors broken open and entered, preceded by his
warriors, who lighted the way. After a great deal
of trouble to keep their torches lighted for the
furious wind which came through the underground
passages, they reached a mysterious room where
they saw a chest which bore the inscription, 'He
who opens me will see miracles.' The king commanded
that it be opened: with incredible difficulty
they succeeded in opening it, but, instead of gold or
diamonds, they found only a roll of linen, on which
were painted some armed Moors, with this inscription
underneath: '<i>Spain will soon be destroyed by
these</i>.' That very night a violent tempest arose,
the enchanted palace fell, and a short time afterward
the Moors entered Spain. You don't seem to
believe it?"</p>

<p>"What stuff you are talking! How can I
believe it?"</p>

<p>"But this history is connected with another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
You know, without doubt, that Count Julian, the
commandant of the fortress of Ceuta, betrayed
Spain and allowed the Moors to pass when he might
have barred the way. But you do not know why
Count Julian turned traitor. He had a daughter at
Toledo, and this daughter went every day with a
number of her young friends to bathe in the Tagus.
As misfortune willed it, the place where they went
to bathe, which was called <i>Los BaÃ±os de la Cava</i>,
was near a tower in which King Roderic was accustomed
to pass the mid-day hours. One day Count
Julian's daughter, who was called Florinda, tired of
sporting in the water, sat down on the river-bank
and said to her companions, 'Companions, let us
see who is the most beautiful.'&mdash;'Let us see!' they
cried, and as soon done as said. They seated themselves
around Florinda, and each one revealed her
beauty. But Florinda surpassed them all, and,
unfortunately, just at the moment when she said to
the others, 'Look!' King Roderic put his head out
of the window and saw them. Young and dissolute,
you may imagine he took fire like a match, paid his
court to the beautiful Florinda, ruined and abandoned
her; and from this followed the fury of the revenge
of Count Julian, the treason, and the invasion."</p>

<p>At this point it seemed that I had listened long
enough: I gave the custodian two <i>reales</i>, which he
took and put in his pocket with a dignified air, and,
giving a last look at Toledo, I descended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>It was the hour for promenading. The principal
street, hardly wide enough for a carriage to pass
through, was full of people; there may have been a
few hundred persons, but they seemed like a great
crowd; it was dusk, the shops were closing, and a
few stray lights began to flicker here and there. I
went to get my dinner, but came out quickly, so as
not to lose sight of the promenade. It was night:
there was no other illumination save the moonlight,
and one could not see the faces of the people; I
seemed to be in the midst of a procession of spectres,
and was overwhelmed with sadness. "To think that
I am alone!" I said&mdash;"that in all this city there is
not a soul who knows me; that if I fall dead at this
moment, there would not be a dog to say, 'Poor
man! he was a good fellow!'" I saw joyous young
men pass, fathers of families with their children,
husbands or those who had the air of husbands
with beautiful creatures on their arms; every one
had a companion; they laughed and talked, and
passed without so much as looking at me. How
wretched I was! How happy I should have been if
a boy, a beggar, or a policeman had come up and
said, "It seems to me that I recognize you, sir"!&mdash;"It
is impossible, I am a foreigner, I have never
been in Toledo before; but it makes no matter;
don't go away; stay here, and we will talk a while,
for I am lonely."</p>

<p>In a happy moment I remembered that at Madrid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
I had received a letter of introduction to a Toledan
gentleman. I hurried to the hotel, took out my letter,
and was at once shown to his house. The gentleman
was at home and received me courteously.
It was such a pleasure to hear my own name again
that I could have thrown my arms around his neck.
He was Antonio Gamero, the author of a highly esteemed
<i>History of Toledo</i>. We spent the evening
together. I asked him a hundred things; he told
me a thousand, and read me some splendid passages
from his book, which made me better acquainted with
Toledo than I should otherwise have been in a
month's residence there.</p>

<p>The city is poor, and worse than poor: it is dead;
the rich have abandoned it for Madrid; the men of
genius have followed the rich; it has no commerce;
the manufacture of cutlery, the only industry which
flourishes, provides a livelihood for some hundreds
of families, but not for the city; popular education
is neglected; the people are lazy and miserable.</p>

<p>But they have not lost their ancient character of
nobility. Like all the peoples of great declining cities,
they are proud and chivalrous; they abhor baseness,
deal justice with their own hands, when they can, to
assassins and thieves and murderers; and, although
the poet Zorilla, in one of his ballads, has bluntly
called them a silly people, they are not so; they are
alert and bold. They combine the seriousness of the
Spaniards of the North with the vivacity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Spaniards of the South; they hold the middle ground
between the Castilian and the Andalusian; they
speak the language with refinement, with a greater
variety of inflexion than the people of Madrid, and
with greater precision than the people of Cordova
and Seville; they love poetry and music; they are
proud to number among their great men the gentle
Garcilaso de la Vega, the reformer of Spanish poetry,
and the illustrious Francisco de Rojas, the author of
the <i>Garcia del CastaÃ±ar</i>; and they take pride in
welcoming within their walls artists and students
from all the countries in the world who come to
study the history of three nations and the monuments
of three civilizations. But, whatever its
people may be, Toledo is dead; the city of Wamba,
of Alfonso the Brave, and of Padilla is nothing but
a tomb. Since Philip II. took from it the crown of
the capital, it has been steadily declining, and is still
declining, and it is consuming itself little by little,
solitary on the summit of its gloomy mountain, like
a skeleton abandoned on a rock in the midst of the
waves of the sea.</p>

<p>I returned to the hotel shortly before midnight.
Although the moon was shining brightly&mdash;for on
moonlight nights they do not illuminate the streets,
although the light of that silvery orb does not penetrate
those narrow ways&mdash;I was obliged to grope my
way along like a thief. With my head full, as it
was, of fantastic ballads which describe the streets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
of Toledo traversed at night by cavaliers muffled in
their cloaks, singing under the windows of their
ladies, fighting and killing one another, climbing
into palaces and stealing the maidens away, I
imagined I should hear the tinkle of guitars, the
clashing of swords, and the cries of the dying.
Nothing of the kind: the streets were deserted and
silent and the windows dark, and one heard faintly
from time to time at the corners and crossways the
light step of some one passing or a fugitive whisper,
the source of which one could in no way discover.
I reached the hotel without harming any fair Toledan,
which might have caused me some annoyance,
and also without having any holes made in my
stomach, which was undoubtedly a consolation.</p>

<p>The morning of the next day I visited the beautiful
building of the hospital of San Cruz, the church
of <i>Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Transito</i>, an ancient synagogue,
the ruins of an amphitheatre and of an arena
where naval battles were fought in Roman times,
and the famous manufactory of arms, where I bought
a beautiful dagger with a silver handle and a blade
covered with arabesques, which at this moment lies
on my table, and when I shut my eyes and take it
in my hand I seem to be still there, in the courtyard
of the factory, a mile out of Toledo, under the mid-day
sun, surrounded by a group of soldiers, and enveloped
in a cloud of smoke from their cigarettes.
I remember that as I was walking back to Toledo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
as I was crossing a bit of country solitary as a desert
and silent as the Catacombs, a terrible voice cried
out, "Away with the foreigner!"</p>

<p>The voice came from the city. I stopped&mdash;I was
the foreigner, that cry was directed at me, and my
blood curdled; the solitude and silence of the place
increased my fear. I started forward and the voice
cried again, "Away with the foreigner!"</p>

<p>"Is it a dream?" I exclaimed, stopping again, "or
am I awake? Who is shouting? Where is he?
Why does he do it?"</p>

<p>I started on again, and the voice came the third
time, "Away with the foreigner!"</p>

<p>I stopped the third time, and when, all disturbed,
I cast my eyes around, I saw a boy sitting on the
ground, who looked at me with a laugh and said,
"He is a crazy man, who thinks he is living in the
time of the War of Independence. Look, sir! that
is the insane asylum." And he pointed out the
place on a hill among the outermost houses of
Toledo. I drew a long breath which would have
blown out a torch.</p>

<p>In the evening I left Toledo, regretting that I had
not time to see once and again all that was ancient
and wonderful in it: this regret was tempered, however,
by my ardent desire for Andalusia, which had
not allowed me a moment's peace. But how long I
saw Toledo before my eyes! How long I remembered
and dreamed of those headlong rocks, those enor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>mous
walls, those dark streets, that fantastic appearance
of a mediÃ¦val city! Even to-day I review
the picture with a sort of sombre pleasure and grave
melancholy, and with this picture before me my
mind wanders back in a thousand strange thoughts
among distant times and marvellous events.</p>

<h2><a name="CORDOVA" id="CORDOVA"></a>CORDOVA.</h2>


<p>On arriving at Castillejo I was obliged to wait
until midnight for the Andalusia train. I dined on
hard-boiled eggs and oranges, with a little sprinkling
of Val de PeÃ±as, murmured a poem of Espronceda,
chatted a little with a custom-house officer who between
parentheses made me a confession of his political
faith&mdash;Amadeus, liberty, an increase of wages
to the custom-house officers, etc; finally I heard
the long-desired whistle, entered a railway-carriage
crowded full of women, children, civil guards, boxes,
cushions, and wraps, and away with a speed unusual
for the Spanish railways. It was a beautiful night;
my travelling-companions talked of bulls and Carlists;
a beautiful girl, whom more than one devoured
with his eyes, pretended to sleep that she might still
further heighten their curiosity; some were rolling
cigarettes, some peeling oranges, others humming
songs from the <i>Zarzuela</i>. Nevertheless, I fell
asleep in a few minutes. I believe I had already
dreamed of the mosque of Cordova and the Alcazar
of Seville, when I was aroused by a hoarse cry,
"Daggers!"</p>

<p>"Daggers? Heavens! for whom?" Before I dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>covered
who had shouted there flashed before my
eyes a long sharp blade, and the unknown voice
asked again,</p>

<p>"Do you like it?"</p>

<p>One must admit that there are pleasanter ways to
be awakened. I looked in the faces of my travelling-companions
with an expression of consternation,
which made them all burst into a shout of laughter.
Then they explained that at every railway-station
there are vendors of knives and daggers who offer
tourists their wares, just as the boys offer newspapers
and refreshments in our country. Assured that my
life was safe, I bought my scarecrow&mdash;five francs;
a splendid dagger for a villain in a tragedy, with an
ornamented handle, inscriptions on the blade, and a
sheath of embroidered velvet; and I put it in my
pocket, thinking that I might find it useful in Italy
to settle difficulties with my publishers.</p>

<p>The vendor must have had fifty of those knives
in a great red sash tied around his waist. Other
travellers bought them, the civil guards complimented
one of my neighbors on the good selection
he had made; the boys cried, "Buy me one too!"
The mammas answered, "We will buy you a bigger
one some other time." "O happy Spain!" I exclaimed,
and thought with horror of our barbarous
laws, which forbid the innocent amusement of a little
cold steel.</p>

<p>We crossed La Mancha, the celebrated La Mancha,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
the immortal theatre of the adventures of Don
Quixote. It is such a place as I imagined&mdash;wide,
bare plains, long tracts of sandy soil, here and there
a windmill, a few wretched villages, lonely lanes,
and forsaken huts. On seeing these places I felt
that vague sense of melancholy which steals over
me as I read the book of Cervantes, and repeated to
myself what I always say on reading it: "This man
cannot make one laugh without also making one's
tears flow as the laughter dies away."</p>

<p>Don Quixote is a sad and sombre figure: his madness
is a lament; his life is the history of the dreams,
illusions, awakenings, and aberrations of each of us;
the struggle of reason with imagination, of truth
with falsehood, of the ideal with the real. We all
have something of Don Quixote in our nature; we
all mistake windmills for giants; we are all now and
then spurred on by the impulse of enthusiasm, only
to be driven back by the laugh of scorn; we are
each a mixture of the sublime and the ridiculous;
we all feel bitterly and profoundly the eternal conflict
between the grandeur of our aspirations and the
impotence of our powers. O beautiful dreams of
childhood and youth! Generous impulses to consecrate
our life to the defence of virtue and justice,
fond imaginations of dangers faced, of adventurous
struggles, of magnanimous deeds, and sublime loves,
fallen one by one, like the petals of a flower, in the
narrow and uneventful paths of life! To what new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
life have they arisen in our soul, and what vague
thoughts and profound inspirations have we derived
from thee, O generous and hapless cavalier of the
sad figure!</p>

<p>We arrived at Argamasilla de Alba, where Don
Quixote was born and died, and where poor Cervantes,
the tax-gatherer of the great priory of San Juan,
was arrested by angry debtors and imprisoned in a
house which is said to be still in existence, and
where he probably conceived the plan of his
romance. We passed near the village of Val de
PeÃ±as, which gives its name to one of the most
exquisite wines of Spain&mdash;dark, tingling, exhilarating,
the only one, forsooth, which permits the
foreigner from the North to indulge in copious
libations at his meals; and finally we arrived at
Santa Cruz de Mudela, a village famous for its
manufactories of <i>navajas</i> (knives and razors), near
which the way begins to slope gently upward toward
the mountain.</p>

<p>The sun had risen, the women and children had
left the carriage, and a number of peasants, officers,
and <i>toreros</i> had entered on their way to Seville.
One saw in that small space a variety of costume
which would not be seen even in an Italian market-place&mdash;the
pointed caps of the peasants of the
Sierra Morena, the red trousers of the soldiers, the
great sombreros of the <i>picadores</i>, the shawls of the
gypsies, the mantles of the Catalans, Toledo blades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
hanging from the walls, capes, belts, and finery of
all the colors of a harlequin.</p>

<p>The train entered the rocks of the Sierra Morena,
which separate the valley of the Guadiana from that
of the Guadalquivir, famous for the songs of poets
and the deeds of brigands. The railway runs at
times between two walls of rock sheer from the very
peaks, so high that to see the top one must put one's
head all the way out of the window and turn one's
face up, as if to look at the roof of the carriage.
Sometimes the rocks are farther away and rise one
above the other, the first like enormous broken
stones, the last straight and sharp like bold towers
rising upon measureless bastions; between them a
mass of boulders cut into teeth, steps, crests, and
humps, some almost hanging in the air, others separated
by deep caverns and frightful precipices, presenting
a confusion of curious forms, of fantastic suggestions
of houses, gigantic figures and ruins, and
offering at every step a thousand outlines and surprising
appearances; and, together with this infinite
variety of form, an infinite variety of color, shadow,
dancing and changing light. For long distances, to
the right, to the left, and overhead, one sees nothing
but stone, without a house, a path, or a patch of
ground where a man could set his foot, and, as one
advances, rocks, ravines, and precipices: everything
grows larger, deeper, and higher until one
reaches the summit of the Sierra, where the solemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
majesty of the spectacle provokes a cry of wonder.</p>

<p>The train stopped a few minutes, and all the travellers
put their heads out of the window.</p>

<p>"Here," said one in a loud voice,&mdash;"here Cardenio
jumped from rock to rock to do penance for
his sins" (Cardenio, one of the most remarkable characters
in <i>Don Quixote</i>, who jumped about among
the rocks of the Sierra in his shirt to do penance for
his sins). "I wish," continued the traveller, "that
Sagasta might have to do the same."</p>

<p>They all laughed, and began to find, each one on
his own account, some political enemy upon whom
in imagination he might inflict this punishment:
one proposed Serrano, another Topete, and a third
another, and so on, until in a few minutes, if their
desires had been realized, one might have seen the
entire Sierra filled with ministers, generals, and
deputies in their shirts skipping from crag to crag
like the famous rock of Alessandro Manzoni.</p>

<p>The train started, the rocks disappeared, and the
delightful valley of the Guadalquivir, the garden of
Spain, the Eden of the Arabs, the paradise of
painters and of poets, blessed Andalusia, revealed
herself to my eyes. I can still feel the thrill of
childish joy with which I hurried to the window,
saying to myself, "Let me enjoy it."</p>

<p>For a long distance the country does not offer any
new appearance to the ardent curiosity of the travel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>ler.
At Vilches there is a vast plain, and beyond it
the level country of Tolosa, where Alfonso VIII.,
king of Castile, won the celebrated victory of <i>de las
Navas</i> over the Mussulman army. The sky was as
clear as air&mdash;in the distance rose the mountains of
the Sierra de Segura. Suddenly I made one of
those quick motions which seemed to correspond to
an unuttered cry of astonishment: the first aloes
with their broad heavy leaves, the unexpected harbingers
of the tropical vegetation, rise beside the
road. Beyond them the fields sprinkled with flowers
begin to appear. The first fields sprinkled, those
which follow almost covered, then vast tracts of
country wholly clothed, with wild poppies, daisies,
iris, mushrooms, cowslips, and buttercups, so that
the country appears like a succession of vast carpets
of purple and gold and snowy white, and far away,
among the trees, innumerable streaks of blue, white,
and yellow until the eye is lost; and hard by, on the
edge of the ditches, the mounds, and the banks, even
to the very track, flowers in beds, groups, and clusters,
one above the other, fashioned like great
bouquets, trembling on their stems, which one can
almost touch with the hand. Then waving fields of
grain with great heavy bearded heads, bordered by
long gardens of roses; then orange-orchards and
vast olive-groves; hillocks varied by a hundred
shades of green, surmounted by ancient Moorish
towers, dotted with many-colored cottages, with here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and there white, graceful bridges, which span rivulets
hidden by the trees. On the horizon rise the
snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada, and below this
white line other blue undulating lines of the nearer
mountains. The country grows ever more various
and blooming: Arjonilla, embowered in an orange-grove
whose limits are lost in the distance; Pedro
Abad, in the midst of a plain covered with vineyards
and orchards; Ventas de Alcolea, on the hills
of the Sierra Morena, crowned with villas and gardens.
We are drawing near to Cordova: the train
flies; one sees little stations half hidden among trees
and flowers; the wind blows the rose-leaves into the
cars, great butterflies sail past the windows, a delicious
perfume fills the air, the travellers are singing,
we pass through an enchanted garden, the aloes,
oranges, palms, and villas become more frequent;
one hears a cry: "Here is Cordova!"</p>

<p>How many beautiful images and how many memories
are recalled by that name!</p>

<p>Cordova, the ancient pearl of the Occident, as the
Moorish poets called her, the city of cities, Cordova
of the thirty burgs and the three thousand mosques,
which contained within her walls the greatest temple
of Islam! Her fame spread through the Orient and
obscured the glory of ancient Damascus,&mdash;from the
remotest regions of Asia the faithful journeyed
toward the banks of the Guadalquivir to prostrate
themselves in the marvellous mihrab of her mosque,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
in the blaze of a thousand brazen lamps cast from
the bells of the Spanish cathedrals. From every
part of the Mohammedan world artists, scholars, and
poets crowded to her flourishing schools, her vast
libraries, and the magnificent courts of her caliphs.
Hither flowed wealth and beauty, drawn by the
fame of her splendor.</p>

<p>And from here they separated, eager for knowledge,
along the coasts of Africa, among the schools of Tunis,
Cairo, Bagdad, and Cufa, as far as India and
China, in search of books, inspiration, and memories;
and the poems sung on the slopes of the Sierra
Morena flew from harp to harp even to the valleys
of the Caucasus, to make the hearts of pilgrims burn
within them. The beautiful, the mighty, the wise
Cordova, crowned with three thousand villages,
proudly reared her white minarets among her orange-groves
and spread through the divine valley a
voluptuous air of gladness and glory.</p>

<p>I descend from the train, cross a garden, and look
around: I am alone; the travellers who came with
me have disappeared in different directions; I still
hear the rumble of the receding carriages; then all is
silent.</p>

<p>It is mid-day: the sky is very clear, the air burning.
I see two white cottages; it is the opening of
a street; I enter and go forward. The street is narrow,
the houses small as the little villas built on the
hillocks of artificial gardens; nearly all of them are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
one story in height, with windows a little way from
the ground, roofs so low that one can almost touch
them with a cane, and very white walls. The street
makes a turn; I look down it; no one is in sight; I
do not hear a step nor a voice. "It must be an
abandoned street," I say, and turn in another direction:
white cottages, closed windows, solitude, and
silence. "Where am I?" I ask myself.</p>

<p>I walk on: the street is so narrow and crooked
that a carriage could not pass through it; to the
right and left one sees other deserted streets, other
white houses, and other closed windows; my step
echoes as in a corridor; the white of the walls is so
bright that the reflection almost blinds me, and I am
obliged to walk with my eyes closed; I seem to be
passing through snow. I reach a little square:
everything is closed, there is no one about. Then a
feeling of vague melancholy begins to steal into my
heart, such as I have never felt before, a mingling
of enjoyment and sorrow like that which children
experience when after a long run they find themselves
in a beautiful country-place and enjoy it, but
with a tremor of fear at being so far away from
home. Above the many roofs rise the palms of the
inner gardens. O fantastic legends of odalisques
and caliphs!</p>

<p>On from street to street and square to square; I
meet a few persons, but they all pass and disappear
like phantoms. The streets are all alike, the houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
have only two or four windows; and there is not a
stain, not a scratch, not a crack in the walls, which
are as smooth and white as a sheet of paper. Now
and then I hear a whisper behind a venetian blind,
and almost at the same moment see a dark head with
a flower in the hair peep out and disappear. I approach
a door.</p>

<p>A <i>patio</i>! How shall I describe a <i>patio</i>? It is not
a courtyard, it is not a garden, it is not a room; it is
the three in one. Between the <i>patio</i> and the street
there is a vestibule. On the four sides of the <i>patio</i>
rise graceful columns which support a sort of balcony
enclosed in glass at the height of the second
story; over the balcony extends a canvas which
shades the court. The vestibule is flagged with
marble, the doorway supported by columns surmounted
by bas-reliefs and closed by a delicate iron
lattice of very beautiful design. At the back of the
<i>patio</i>, opposite the doorway, stands a statue, in the
centre a fountain, and all around chairs, work-tables,
paintings, and vases of flowers. I run to another
door. Another <i>patio</i>, its walls covered with ivy,
and a line of niches containing statuettes and urns.
I hurry to a third door. A <i>patio</i> with its walls
adorned with mosaic, a palm in the centre, and all
around a mass of flowers. A fourth door. Behind
the <i>patio</i> another vestibule, and then a second <i>patio</i>,
in which one sees other statues, columns, and fountains.
And all these rooms and gardens are clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
and tidy, so that you could pass your hands over the
walls and along the floor without leaving a mark;
and they are fresh and fragrant, lighted with a dim
light which heightens their beauty and mystery.</p>

<p>Still forward, from street to street, at random.
Gradually, as I walk on, my curiosity increases and
I hasten my steps. It seems impossible that the
whole city can be like this: I am afraid of coming
upon a house or finding a street which will remind
me of other cities and rouse me from my pleasant
dream.</p>

<p>But, no: the dream is unbroken. Everything is
small, graceful, mysterious. Every hundred paces a
deserted little square, in which I stop breathless;
now and then a crossway, and not a living soul;
and everything always white&mdash;closed windows and
silence. At every door there is a new spectacle:
arches, columns, flowers, fountains, palms; a marvellous
variety of design, color, light, perfume, here
of roses, there of oranges, yonder of violets; and
with the perfume a breath of fresh air, and borne on
the air the subdued sound of women's voices, the
rustling of leaves, and the singing of birds&mdash;a sweet
and various harmony, which, without disturbing the
silence of the street, soothes the ear like the echo of
distant music. Ah! it is not a dream! Madrid,
Italy, Europe, surely they are far, far away. Here
one lives another life, here one breathes the air of
another world; I am in the Orient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>I remember that at a certain point I stopped in
the middle of the street and suddenly discovered, I
know not how, that I was sad and restless, and that
in my heart there was a void which neither admiration
nor enjoyment could fill. I felt an irrepressible
necessity of entering those houses and those gardens,
of tearing asunder, so to speak, the mysterious veil
which concealed the life of the unknown people
within; of sharing in that life; of grasping some
hand and gazing into two pitying eyes, and saying,
"I am a stranger, I am alone; I too want to be
happy; let me linger among your flowers, let me
enjoy all the secrets of your paradise, teach me who
you are and how you live; smile on me and calm me,
for my head is burning!"</p>

<p>And this sadness grew upon me until I said to
myself, "I cannot stay in this city; I am suffering
here; I will leave it!"</p>

<p>And I believe I should have left if at a happy
moment I had not remembered that I carried in my
pocket a letter of introduction to two young men of
Cordova, brothers of a friend of mine in Florence.
I dismissed the idea of leaving, and started at once
to find them.</p>

<p>How they laughed when I told them of the impression
Cordova had made upon me! They proposed
that we go at once to see the cathedral; so
we turned down a narrow white street and were
off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>The mosque of Cordova, which was converted
into a cathedral after the overthrow of the Moors,
but which must always remain a mosque, was built
on the ruins of the original cathedral, a little way
back from the bank of the Guadalquivir. Abdurrahman
commenced its construction in the year 785
or 786 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> "Let us rear a mosque," said he,
"which shall surpass that of Bagdad, of Damascus,
and of Jerusalem&mdash;a mosque which shall be the
greatest temple of Islam, one which shall become
the Mecca of the West." They undertook the work
with great ardor. Christian slaves carried the stone
for its foundations from their ruined churches; Abdurrahman
himself worked an hour every day; in
a few years the mosque was built, the caliphs who
succeeded Abdurrahman embellished it, and after a
century of almost continuous labor it was finished.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" said one of my friends, stopping
suddenly in front of a vast edifice.</p>

<p>I thought it was a fortress, but it was the wall
which surrounds the mosque&mdash;an old embattled wall
in which there were at one time twenty great bronze
doors ornamented with the most beautiful arabesques,
and arched windows supported by graceful columns,
now covered by a triple coat of plaster. A turn
around this wall is a nice little walk to take after
dinner: one may judge, therefore, of the vast size
of the building.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><i><a id="Court_of_Oranges"></a>Court of Oranges, Mosque of Cordova</i></div>
<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b068c.jpg" alt="" /></div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>The principal door of the enclosure is north of
the point where rises the minaret of Abdurrahman,
from whose summit floated the Mohammedan standard.
We entered: I expected to see at once the
interior of the mosque, but found myself in a garden
full of orange trees, cypresses, and palms, surrounded
on three sides by a very beautiful portico and closed
on the fourth side by the faÃ§ade of the mosque.
In the midst of this garden there was, in the time
of the Moors, the fountain for their ablutions, and
in the shade of these trees the faithful refreshed
themselves before entering the sanctuary.</p>

<p>I stood for some moments looking around and
breathing in the fresh odorous air with the liveliest
sense of pleasure, and my heart leaped at the
thought of the famous mosque standing there before
me, and I felt myself impelled toward the door by
a boundless curiosity, and at the same time restrained
by I know not what feeling of childish hesitation.</p>

<p>"Let us enter," said my companions. "One
moment more," I replied: "let me thoroughly enjoy
the delight of anticipation." Finally I moved forward
and entered, without so much as looking at
the marvellous doorway which my companions
pointed out.</p>

<p>What I did or said on entering I do not know, but
some strange exclamation must surely have escaped
me or I must have made an odd gesture, for some
persons who were just then coming toward me began
to laugh and turned again to look around, as if to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
discover the reason of the profound emotion which
I had manifested.</p>

<p>Imagine a forest and suppose yourself in the
thickest part, where you see only the trunks of
trees. So in the mosque wherever you turn your
gaze is lost among the columns. It is a forest of
marble whose boundaries one cannot discover. One
follows with the eye, one by one, those lengthening
rows of columns crossed at every step by innumerable
other rows, and perceives a dimly-lighted background
in which one seems to see the gleaming of
still other columns. There are nineteen naves which
extend in the direction in which you enter, crossed
by thirty-three other naves, and supported, in all,
by more than nine hundred columns of porphyry,
jasper, onyx, and marble of every color. Each
column is surmounted by a pilaster, and between one
column and the next bends an arch, and a second
arch above the first extends from pilaster to pilaster,
both of them in the form of a horseshoe; and so,
imagining the columns to be the trunks of so many
trees and the arches to represent the branches, the
resemblance of the mosque to a forest is complete.</p>

<p>The central nave, much larger than the others,
leads to the Maksura, the most sacred part of the
temple, where they worshipped the Koran. Here
from the vaulted windows steals a faint ray of light
which glides along a row of columns; there a dark
place, and yonder another ray pierces the gloom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
another nave. It is impossible to express the feeling
of mystical wonder which fills one's mind at this
spectacle. It is like the sudden revelation of a religion,
a nature, and a life unknown, leading the
fancy captive among the delights of that paradise
of love and pleasure where the blessed, sitting in the
shade of leafy plane trees and of thornless roses,
drink from crystal beakers wine gleaming like
pearls, mixed by immortal children, and repose in
the embrace of lovely virgins with great dark eyes!
All the images of that external pleasure, eager,
warm, and glowing, which the Koran promises to
the faithful, crowd upon the mind at the first sight
of the mosque, and give one a delicious moment of
intoxication which leaves in the heart an indescribable
feeling of gentle melancholy. A brief tumult
in the mind and a rapid thrill which goes tingling
through the veins,&mdash;such is one's first sensation on
entering the cathedral of Cordova.</p>

<p>We began to wander from passage to passage, examining
everything minutely. What a variety in
that edifice which at first sight appears so uniform!
The proportions of the columns, the design of the
capitals, the form of the arches change, one may
say, at every step. The greater part of the columns
are old and were taken by the Moors from Northern
Spain, Gaul, and Roman Africa, and one is said to
have belonged to a temple of Janus, upon whose
ruins stood the church which the Arabians destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
to build the mosque. On several of the capitals one
may still see the traces of the crosses carved upon
them, which the Arabians broke off with their
hammers. In some of the columns iron rings are
fastened to which it is said the Arabians bound the
Christians, and among the others there is one
pointed out to which the popular tradition narrates
a Christian was bound for many years, and in that
time, by continually scratching with his nails, he
succeeded in engraving a cross on the stone, which
the guides show with profound veneration.</p>

<p>We entered the Maksura, which is the most perfect
and marvellous work of Moorish art of the twelfth
century. At the entrance there are three continuous
chapels, with vaulted roofs formed by indented
arches, and walls covered with magnificent mosaics
which represent wreaths and flowers and passages
from the Koran. At the back of the middle chapel
is the principal <i>mihrab</i>, the holy place, where dwelt
the Spirit of God. It is a niche with an octagonal
base enclosed above by a colossal marble shell. In
the <i>mihrab</i> was kept the Koran written by the hands
of the caliph Othman, covered with gold, adorned
with pearls, suspended above a seat of aloe-wood;
and here came thousands of the faithful to
make the circuit of it seven times on their knees.
On approaching the wall I felt the pavement slipping
from under me: the marble had been worn
hollow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>On leaving the niche I stood a long time contemplating
the vault and the walls of the principal
chapel, the only part of the mosque which has been
preserved almost intact. It is a dazzling flash of
crystals of a thousand colors, an interweaving of
arabesques which confuse the mind, a mingling of
bas-reliefs, gilding, ornaments, and minute details of
design and coloring of a delicacy, grace, and perfection
which would prove the despair of the most patient
artist. It is impossible to retain in one's mind
any part of that prodigious work: you might return
a hundred times to look at it, but in reality it would
only remain before your eyes as a tantalizing blur
of blue, red, green, golden, and luminous shades of
colors, or a very intricate piece of embroidery continually
and rapidly changing in color and design.
Only from the ardent and tireless imagination of the
Moors could such a miracle of art have issued.</p>

<p>We began to wander through the mosque again,
observing here and there on the walls the arabesques
of the ancient doorways which are now and then
discovered under the detestable plaster of the Christians.
My companions looked at me, laughed, and
whispered something to each other. "Have you
not seen it yet?" one of them asked me.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>They looked at me again and smiled.</p>

<p>"You think you have seen all the mosque, do
you?" continued my companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," I replied, looking around.</p>

<p>"Well," said the first, "you have not seen it all,
and what remains to be seen is nothing less than a
church."</p>

<p>"A church?" I exclaimed stupefied, "but where
is it?"</p>

<p>"Look!" answered my other companion, pointing;
"it is in the very centre of the mosque."</p>

<p>"By the powers!" And I had not seen it!</p>

<p>From this one may judge of the vastness of the
mosque.</p>

<p>We went to see the church. It is beautiful and
very rich, with a magnificent high altar and a choir
worthy to stand beside those in the cathedrals of
Burgos and Toledo, but, like everything out of
place, it moves one to anger rather than admiration.
Without this church the appearance of the mosque
would be much improved. Charles V., who himself
gave the chapter permission to build it, repented
when he saw the Mohammedan temple for the first
time. Besides the church there is a sort of Moorish
chapel in a good state of preservation, rich in mosaics
not less varied and splendid than those of the
Maksura, and where it is said the ministers of the
faith used to assemble to discuss the book of the
Prophet.</p>

<p>Such is the mosque to-day. But what must it
have been in the time of the Arabs! It was not entirely
enclosed by a wall, but open, so that one could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
see the garden from every side, and from the garden
one could look to the very end of the long naves,
and the fragrance of orange-blossoms and flowers
was wafted even to the vaulted roofs of the Maksura.
The columns, which now number less than a thousand,
were then fourteen hundred in number; the
ceiling was of cedar-wood and larch, carved and enamelled
with exquisite workmanship; the walls were
lined with marble; the light of eight hundred lamps
filled with fragrant oil made the crystals in the mosaic-work
flash like pearls, and produced on the pavement,
the arches, and the walls a marvellous play of
color and reflection. "A sea of splendors," sang a
poet, filled the mysterious enclosure, and the warm
air was laden with perfume and harmony, and the
thoughts of the faithful wandered and were lost in
the labyrinth of columns gleaming like lances in the
sun.</p>

<p>Frederick Schrack, the author of a good work on
the <i>Poetry and Art of the Moors in Spain and Sicily</i>,
gives a description of the mosque on a day of solemn
festival, which forms a very lively image of the Mohammedan
religion and completes the picture of the
monument.</p>

<p>On both sides of the almimbar, or pulpit, wave
two banners, to signify that Islam has triumphed
over Judaism and Christianity and that the Koran
has conquered both the Old and the New Testament.
The <i>almnedani</i> ascend to the gallery of the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
minaret and intone the salam, or salutation, to the
Prophet. Then the aisles of the mosque are filled
with believers, who with white vestments and in
festal attire come together to worship. In a few
moments, throughout the length and breadth of the
edifice, one sees only kneeling people. The caliph
enters by the secret way which leads from the Alcazar
to the temple, and seats himself in his elevated
station. A reader of the Koran reads a <i>sura</i> from
the low desk of the pulpit.</p>

<p>The voice of the muezzin sounds again, calling
men to mid-day prayer. All the faithful rise and
murmur their prayers, bowing as they do so. An
attendant of the mosque opens the doors of the pulpit
and seizes a sword, and, holding it, he turns
toward Mecca, admonishing the people to worship
Mohammed, while the <i>mubaliges</i> are chanting his
praises from the gallery. Then the preacher mounts
the pulpit, taking from the hand of the servant the
sword, which calls to mind and symbolizes the subjection
of Spain to the power of Islam. It is the
day when the <i>Djihad</i>, or the holy war, must be proclaimed,
the call for all able-bodied men to go to
war and descend into the battlefield against the
Christians. The multitude listens with silent devotion
to the sermon, woven from texts of the Koran,
which begins in this wise:</p>

<p>"Praise be to Allah, who has increased the glory
of Islam, thanks to the sword of the champion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
faith, who in his holy book has promised succor and
victory to the believer.</p>

<p>"Allah scatters his benefits over the world.</p>

<p>"If he did not put it in the hearts of men to take
up arms against their fellows, the world would be lost.</p>

<p>"Allah has ordained to fight against the people
until they know that there is but one God.</p>

<p>"The torch of war will not be extinguished until
the end of the world.</p>

<p>"The blessing of God will fall upon the mane of
the war-horse to the day of judgment.</p>

<p>"Armed from head to foot or but lightly clad, it
matters not&mdash;up and away!</p>

<p>"O believers! what shall be done to you if, when
called to the battle, you remain with face turned to
the earth?</p>

<p>"Do you prefer the life of this world to the life
to come?</p>

<p>"Believe me, the gates of paradise stand in the
shadow of the sword.</p>

<p>"He who dies in battle for the cause of God shall
wash away with his blood all the defilement of his
sins.</p>

<p>"His body shall not be wasted like the other
bodies of the dead, for on the day of judgment his
wounds shall yield a fragrance like musk.</p>

<p>"When the warriors present themselves at the
gates of paradise, a voice within shall ask, 'What
have you done in your life?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>"And they shall answer, 'We have brandished
the sword in the struggle for the cause of God.'</p>

<p>"Then the eternal doors will swing open, and the
warriors will enter forty years before the rest.</p>

<p>"Up, then, ye faithful; leave your women, your
children, your kindred, and your goods, and go out
to the holy war!</p>

<p>"And thou, God, Lord of this present world
and of that which is to come, fight for the armies
of those who recognize thy unity! Cast down the
unbelievers, the idolaters, and the enemies of thy
holy faith! Overwhelm their standards, and give
them, with whatever they possess, as a prey to the
Mussulman!"</p>

<p>The preacher as he ends his discourse turns toward
the congregation and exclaims, "Ask of God!" and
begins to pray in silence.</p>

<p>All the faithful, with heads bowed to the ground,
follow his example. The <i>mubaliges</i> chant, "Amen!
Amen, O Lord of all being!" Burning like the heat
which precedes the oncoming tempest, the enthusiasm
of the multitude, restrained at first in awful silence,
now breaks out into deep murmurs, which rise like
the waves and swell through all parts of the temple,
until finally the naves, the chapels, and the vaulted
roofs resound to the echo of a thousand voices
united in a single cry: "There is no God but
Allah!"</p>

<p>The mosque of Cordova is even to-day, by uni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>versal
consent, the most beautiful temple of Islam
and one of the most marvellous monuments in the
world.</p>

<p>When we left the mosque it was already long past
the hour of the siesta, which everybody takes in the
cities of Southern Spain, and which is a necessity
by reason of the insupportable heat of the noon
hours. The streets began to fill with people.
"Alas!" said I to my companions, "how badly the
silk hat looks in the streets of Cordova! How have
you the heart to introduce the fashion-plates in this
beautiful Oriental picture? Why do you not adopt
the dress of the Moors?" Coxcombs pass, workmen,
and girls: I looked at them all with great
curiosity, hoping to find one of those fantastic
figures which DorÃ© has represented as examples
of the Andalusian type, with that dark-brown complexion,
those thick lips, and large eyes, but I saw
none. Walking toward the centre of the city, I
saw the first Andalusian women&mdash;ladies, girls and
women of the middle classes&mdash;almost all small, graceful,
and well-formed, some of them beautiful, many
attractive in appearance, but the greater part neither
one thing nor the other, as is the case in all countries.
In their dress, with the exception of the so-called
mantilla, they do not differ at all from the
French women nor from those of our country&mdash;great
masses of false hair in plaits, knots, and long
curls, short petticoats, long plaited over-skirts, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
boots with heels as sharp as daggers. The ancient
Andalusian costume has disappeared from the city.</p>

<p>I thought that in the evening the streets would be
crowded, but I saw only a few people, and only in
the streets of the principal quarters; the others
remain as empty as at the hour of the siesta. And
one must pass through those deserted streets at night
to enjoy Cordova. One sees the light streaming
from the <i>patios</i>; one sees in the dark corners fond
lovers in close colloquy, the girls usually at the windows,
with a hand resting lightly on the iron grating,
and the young men close to the wall in poetic attitudes,
with watchful eyes, but not so watchful, however,
as to make them take their lips from those
hands before they discover that some one is passing;
and one hears the sound of guitars, the murmur
of fountains, sighs, the laughter of children, and
mysterious rustlings.</p>

<p>The following morning, still stirred by the Oriental
dreams of the night, I again began my wandering
through the city. To describe all that is remarkable
there one would require a volume: it is a
very museum of Roman and Arabian antiquities,
and one finds a profusion of martial columns and
inscriptions in honor of the emperors; the remains
of statues and bas-reliefs; six ancient gates; a great
bridge over the Guadalquivir dating from the time
of Octavius Augustus and restored by the Arabians;
ruins of towers and walls; houses which belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
to the caliphs, and which still contain the columns
and the subterranean arches of the bathing apartments;
and everywhere there are doors, vestibules,
and stairways that would delight a legion of archÃ¦ologists.</p>

<p>Toward noon, as I was passing through a lonely
little street, I saw a sign on the wall of a house
beside a Roman inscription, <i>Casa de huespedes.
Almuerzos y comidas</i>, and as I read I felt the gnawing,
as Giusti says, of such a desperate hunger that
I determined to give it a quietus in this little shop
upon which I had stumbled. I passed through a
little vestibule, and found myself in a <i>patio</i>. It was
a poor little <i>patio</i>, without marble floor and without
fountains, but white as snow and fresh as a garden.
As I saw neither tables nor chairs, I feared I had
mistaken the door and started to go out. A little
old woman bustled out from I know not where and
stopped me.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to eat?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she answered.</p>

<p>"What have you?"</p>

<p>"Eggs, sausages, chops, peaches, oranges, and
wine of Malaga."</p>

<p>"Very good: you may bring everything you
have."</p>

<p>She commenced by bringing me a table and a
chair, and I sat down and waited. Suddenly I heard
a door open behind me and turned.... Angels of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
heaven! what a sight I saw!&mdash;the most beautiful of
all the most beautiful Andalusians, not only of those
whom I saw at Cordova, but of all those whom I
afterward saw at Seville, Cadiz, and Granada: if I
may be allowed to use the word, a superb girl, who
would make one flee or commit some deviltry; one
of those faces which make you cry, "O poor me!"
like Giuseppe Baretti when he was travelling in
Spain. For some moments she stood motionless
with her eyes fixed on mine as if to say, "Admire
me;" then she turned toward the kitchen and cried,
"<i>Tia, despachate!</i>" ("Hurry up, aunty!") This
gave me an opportunity of thanking her with a
stammering tongue, and gave her a pretence for approaching
me and replying, "It is nothing," with a
voice so gentle that I was obliged to offer her a
chair, whereupon she sat down. She was a girl
about twenty years old, tall, straight as a palm, and
dark, with two great eyes full of sweetness, lustrous
and humid as though she had just been in tears:
she wore a mass of wavy jet-black hair with a rose
among her locks. She seemed like one of the Arabian
virgins of the tribe of the Usras for whom men
died of love.</p>

<p>She herself opened the conversation:</p>

<p>"You are a foreigner, I should think, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"French?"</p>

<p>"Italian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>"Italian? A fellow-countryman of the king?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know him, sir?"</p>

<p>"By sight!"</p>

<p>"They say he is a handsome young fellow."</p>

<p>I did not answer, and she began to laugh, and
asked me, "What are you looking at, sir?" and,
still laughing, she hid her foot, which on taking her
seat she thrust well forward that I might see it.
Ah! there is not a woman in that country who does
not know that the feet of the Andalusians are famous
throughout the world.</p>

<p>I seized the opportunity of turning the conversation
upon the fame of the Andalusian women, and
expressed my admiration in the most fervent words
of my vocabulary. She allowed me to talk on, looking
with great attention at the crack in the table,
then raising her face, she asked me, "And in Italy,
how are the women there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are beautiful women in Italy too."</p>

<p>"But ... they are cold?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, not at all," I hastened to respond; "but,
you know, ... in every country the women have
an <i>I-know-not-what</i> which distinguishes them from
the women of all other countries; and among them all
the <i>I-know-not-what</i> of the Andalusians is probably
the most dangerous for a poor traveller whose hairs
have not turned gray. There is a word to express
what I mean: if I could remember it, I would say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
it to you; I would say, "<i>SeÃ±orita</i>, you are the
most ..."</p>

<p>"<i>Salada</i>," exclaimed the girl, covering her face
with her hands.</p>

<p>"<i>Salada!</i> ... the most <i>salada</i> Andalusian in
Cordova."</p>

<p><i>Salada</i> is the word commonly used in Andalusia
to describe a woman beautiful, charming, affectionate,
languid, ardent, what you will&mdash;a woman with
two lips which say, "Drink me," and two eyes
which make one close one's teeth.</p>

<p>The aunt brought me the eggs, chops, sausage,
and oranges, and the girl continued the conversation:
"Sir, you are an Italian: have you seen the
Pope?"</p>

<p>"No, I am sorry to say."</p>

<p>"Is it possible? An Italian who has not seen the
Pope! And tell me, sir: why do the Italians make
him suffer so much?"</p>

<p>"Suffer in what way?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They say that they have shut him up in
his house and thrown stones at the windows."</p>

<p>"Oh no! Don't believe it! There is not a particle
of truth in it," etc., etc.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Venice, sir?"</p>

<p>"Venice? oh yes."</p>

<p>"Is it true that it is a city which floats on the
sea?"</p>

<p>And here she made a thousand requests that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
would describe Venice, and that I would tell her
what the people were like in that strange city, and
what they do all the day long, and how they dress.
And while I was talking besides the pains I took
to express myself with a little grace, and to eat
meanwhile the badly-cooked eggs and stale sausage&mdash;I
was obliged to see her draw nearer and nearer
to me, that she might hear me better perhaps, without
being conscious of the act. She came so close
that I could smell the fragrance of the rose in her
hair and feel her warm breath; I was obliged, I may
say, to make three efforts at once&mdash;one with my
head, another with my stomach, and a third with
both&mdash;especially when, now and then, she would say,
"How beautiful!"&mdash;a compliment which applied to
the Grand Canal, but which had upon me the effect
a bag full of napoleons might have upon a beggar if
swung under his nose by an insolent banker.</p>

<p>"Ah, seÃ±orita!" I said at last, beginning to lose
patience, "what matters it, after all, whether cities
are beautiful or not? Those who are born in them
think nothing of it, and the traveller still less. I
arrived at Cordova yesterday: it is a beautiful city,
without doubt. Well&mdash;will you believe it?&mdash;I have
already forgotten all that I have seen; I no longer
wish to see anything; I do not even know what city
I am in. Palaces, mosques, they make me laugh.
When you have a consuming fire in your heart, do
you go to the mosque to quench it?&mdash;Excuse me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
will you move back a little?&mdash;When you feel such a
madness that you could grind up a plate with your
teeth, do you go to look at palaces? Believe me,
the traveller's life is a sad one. It is a penance of
the hardest sort. It is torture. It is...." A
prudent blow with her fan closed my mouth, which
was going too far both in words and action. I attacked
the chop.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" murmured the Andalusian with a
laugh after she had given a glance around. "Are
all the Italians as ardent as you?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? Are all the Andalusians
as beautiful as you?"</p>

<p>The girl laid her hand on the table.</p>

<p>"Take that hand away," I said.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because I want to eat in peace."</p>

<p>"Eat with one hand."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>I seemed to be pressing the little hand of a girl
of six; my knife fell to the ground; a dark veil
settled upon the chop.</p>

<p>Suddenly my hand was empty: I opened my
eyes, saw the girl all disturbed, and looked behind
me. Gracious Heavens! There was a handsome
young fellow, with a stylish little jacket, tight
breeches, and a velvet cap. Oh terrors! a <i>torero</i>!
I gave a start as if I had felt two <i>banderillas de
fuego</i> planted in my neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>"I see it at a glance," said I to myself, like the
man at the comedy; and one could not fail to understand.
The girl, slightly embarrassed, made the introduction:
"An Italian passing through Cordova,"
and she hastened to add, "who wants to know when
the train leaves for Seville."</p>

<p>The <i>torero</i>, who had frowned at first sight of me,
was reassured, told me the hour of departure, sat
down, and entered into a friendly conversation. I
asked for the news of the last bull-fight at Cordova:
he was a <i>banderillero</i>, and he gave me a minute
description of the day's sport. The girl in the
mean time was gathering flowers from the vases in
the <i>patio</i>. I finished my meal, offered a glass of
Malaga to the <i>torero</i>, drank to the fortunate planting
of all his <i>banderillas</i>, paid my bill (three <i>pesetas</i>,
which included the beautiful eyes, you understand),
and then, putting on a bold front, so as to dispel the
least shadow of suspicion from the mind of my
formidable rival, I said to the girl, "<i>SeÃ±orita!</i> one
can refuse nothing to those who are taking leave.
To you I am like a dying man; you will never see
me again; you will never hear my name spoken:
then let me take some memento; give me that bunch
of flowers."</p>

<p>"Take it," said the girl; "I picked it for you."</p>

<p>She glanced at the <i>torero</i>, who gave a nod of
approval.</p>

<p>"I thank you with all my heart," I replied as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
turned to leave. They both accompanied me to the
door.</p>

<p>"Have you bull-fights in Italy?" asked the young
man.</p>

<p>"Oh heavens! no, not yet!"</p>

<p>"Too bad! Try to make them popular in Italy
also, and I will come to <i>banderillar</i> at Rome."</p>

<p>"I will do all in my power.&mdash;<i>SeÃ±orita</i>, have the
goodness to tell me your name, so that I may bid
you good-bye."</p>

<p>"Consuelo."</p>

<p>"God be with you, Consuelo!"</p>

<p>"God be with you, <i>SeÃ±or Italiano</i>!"</p>

<p>And I went out into the lonely little street.</p>

<p>There are no remarkable Arabian monuments to
be seen in the neighborhood of Cordova, although at
one time the whole valley was covered with magnificent
buildings. Three miles to the south of the
city, on the side of the mountain, rose the Medina
Az-Zahra, the city of flowers, one of the most
marvellous architectural works of the caliph Abdurrahman,
begun by the caliph himself in honor
of his favorite Az-Zahra. The foundations were
laid in the year 936, and ten thousand workmen
labored on the edifice for twenty-five years. The
Arabian poets celebrated Medina Az-Zahra as the
most splendid of royal palaces and the most delightfullyl
garden in the world. It was not an edifice, but
a vast chain of palaces, gardens, courts, colonnades,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and towers. There were rare plants from Syria&mdash;the
fantastic playing of lofty fountains, streams of
water flowing in the shade of palm trees, and great
basins overflowing with quicksilver, which reflected
the rays of the sun like lakes of fire; doors of
ebony and ivory studded with gems; thousands of
columns of the most precious marbles; great airy
balconies; and between the innumerable multitudes
of statues twelve images of animals of massy gold,
gleaming with pearls, sprinkling sweetened water
from their mouths and noses. In this vast palace
swarmed thousands of servants, slaves, and women,
and hither from every part of the world came poets
and musicians. And yet this same Abdurrahman
III., who lived among all these delights, who reigned
for fifty years, who was powerful, glorious, and fortunate
in every circumstance and enterprise, wrote
before his death that during his long reign he had
been happy only fourteen days, and his fabulous city
of flowers seventy-four years after the laying of its
first stone was invaded, sacked, and burned by a
barbarian horde, and to-day there remain only a few
stones which hardly recall its name.</p>

<p>Of another splendid city, called Zahira, which rose
to the east of Cordova, built by the powerful Almansur,
governor of the kingdom, not even the ruins
remain: a handful of rebels laid it in ashes a little
while after the death of its founder.</p>

<p>
"All returns to the great ancient mother."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>Instead of taking a drive around Cordova, I
simply wandered here and there, weaving fancies
from the names of the streets, which to me is one
of the greatest pleasures in which a traveller may
indulge in a foreign city. Cordova, <i>alma ingeniorum
parens</i>, could write at every street-corner the name
of an artist or an illustrious author born within her
walls; to give her due honor, she has remembered
them all with maternal gratitude. You find the
little square of Seneca and the house where he may
have been born; the street of Ambrosio Morales, the
historian of Charles V., who continued the <i>Chronicle
General of Spain</i> commenced by Florian d'Ocampo;
the street of Pablo de Cespedes, painter, architect,
sculptor, antiquary, and the author of a didactic
poem, "The Art of Painting," unfortunately not
finished, though adorned with splendid passages.
He was an ardent enthusiast of Michelangelo, whose
works he had admired in Italy, and in his poem he
addressed a hymn of praise to him which is one of
the most beautiful passages in Spanish poetry, and,
in spite of myself, the last verses have slipped from
my pen, which every Italian, even if he does not
know the sister language, can appreciate and understand.
He believes, he tells the reader, that one
cannot find the perfection of painting anywhere
except</p>

<p>"In that excellent marvellous work, greater than
all that has ever been painted, which Buonarroti
made with his divine hand in the Etruscan Vatican!</p>

<p>"Look how the new Prometheus, rising in lofty
flight, extends his wings so wide that above the
starry sky he has obtained a part of the celestial
fire; with it, returning, he enriched the earth with
new marvels and new surprises, giving life, with
eternal splendors, to marble, bronze, and colors.
More than mortal man! angel divine! or what shall
I call thee? Surely thou art not human, who from
the empyrean circle came, bringing life and harmony
to chisel and brush! Thou hast shown men the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
hidden for a thousand ages, uncertain of the sovereign
virtue; to thee belongs honor which one day the sun
will bestow."</p>

<p>Murmuring these lines, I came out into the street
of Juan de Mena, the Ennius of Spain, as his compatriots
call him, the author of a phantasmagorial
poem called "The Labyrinth," an imitation of <i>The
Divina Commedia</i> very famous in its day, and in
truth not without some pages of inspired and noble
poetry, but, on the whole, cold and overloaded with
pedantic mysticism. John II., king of Castile, went
mad over this "Labyrinth," kept it beside the missal
in his cabinet, and carried it with him to the hunt;
but witness the caprice of a king! The poem had
only three hundred stanzas, and to John II. this
number seemed too small, and do you know the
reason? It was this: the year contains three
hundred and sixty-five days, and it seemed to him
that there ought to be as many stanzas in the poem
as there are days in the year, and so he besought
the poet to compose sixty-five other stanzas, and the
poet complied with his request&mdash;most cheerfully, the
flatterer!&mdash;to gain an occasion for flattering still
more, although he had already flattered his sovereign
to the extent of asking him to correct the poem.</p>

<p>From the street of Juan de Mena I passed into the
street of Gongora, the Marini of Spain, and no less
a genius than he, but perhaps one who corrupted
the literature of his country even more than Marini<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
corrupted that of Italy, for he spoiled, abused, and
corrupted the language in a thousand ways: for this
reason Lope de Vega wittily makes a poet of the
Gongorist school ask one of his hearers, "Do you
understand me?"&mdash;"Yes," he replies; and the poet
retorts, "You lie! for I do not even understand
myself." But Lope himself is not entirely free from
Gongorism, for he has the courage to write that
Tasso was only the rising of Marini's sun; nor is
Calderon entirely free of it, nor some other great
men. But enough of poetry: I must not digress.</p>

<p>After the siesta I hunted up my two companions,
who took me through the suburbs of the city, and
here, for the first time, I saw men and women of the
true Andalusian type as I had imagined them, with
eyes, coloring, and attitudes like the Arabians, and
here too, for the first time, I heard the real speech
of the Andalusian people, softer and more musical
than in the Castiles, and also gayer and more imaginative,
and accompanied by livelier gestures. I
asked my companions whether that report about
Andalusia is true, affirming that with their early
physical development vice is more common, manners
more voluptuous, and passion less restrained. "Too
true," they replied, giving explanations, descriptions,
and citing cases which I forbear to repeat. On returning
to the city they took me to a splendid casino,
with gardens and magnificent rooms, in one of which,
the largest and richest, adorned with paintings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
all the illustrious men of Cordova, rises a sort of
stage where the poets stand to read their works on
evenings appointed for public contests of genius;
and the victors receive a laurel crown from the
hands of the most beautiful and cultured girls in the
city, who, crowned with roses, look on from a semi-circle
of seats. That evening I had the pleasure of
meeting several young Cordovese ardently attached,
as they say in Spain, to the cultivation of the Muses&mdash;frank,
courteous, and vivacious, with a medley of
verses in their heads, and a smattering of Italian
literature; and so imagine how from dusk to midnight,
through those mysterious streets, which from
the first evening had made my head whirl, there was
a constant, noisy interchange of sonnets, hymns, and
ballads in the two languages, from Petrarch to Prati,
from Cervantes to Zorilla; and a delightful conversation
closed and sealed by many cordial hand-clasps
and eager promises to write, to send books, to come
to Italy, to visit Spain again, etc. etc.&mdash;merely
words, as is always the case, but words not less dear
on that account.</p>

<p>In the morning I left for Seville. At the station
I saw Frascuelo, Lagartijo, Cuco, and the whole
band of <i>toreros</i> from Madrid, who saluted me with
a benevolent look of protection. I hurried into a
dusty carriage, and as the train moved off and my
eyes rested on Cordova for the last time, I bade the
city adieu in the lines of the Arabian poet&mdash;a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
too tropical, if you will, for the taste of a European,
but, after all, admirable for the occasion:</p>

<p>"Adieu, Cordova! Would that my life were as
long as Noah's, that I might live for ever within thy
walls! Would that I had the treasures of Pharaoh,
to spend them upon wine and the beautiful women
of Cordova with the gentle eyes which invite
kisses!"</p>

<h2><a name="SEVILLE" id="SEVILLE"></a>SEVILLE.</h2>


<p>The journey from Cordova to Seville does not
awaken a sense of astonishment, as does that from
Toledo to Cordova, but it is even more beautiful:
there are continuous orange-orchards, boundless
olive-groves, hills clothed with vineyards, and
meadows carpeted with flowers. A few miles from
Cordova one sees the ruined towers of the frowning
castle of Almodovar standing on a very high rock-platform,
which overlooks a vast extent of the surrounding
country; at Hornachuelos another old
castle on the summit of a hill, in the midst of a
lonely, melancholy landscape; and then, beyond,
the white city of Palma, hidden in a dense orange-grove,
which is surrounded in its turn by a circle
of truck-farms and flower-gardens. As the train
runs on one is carried through the midst of golden
fields of grain, bordered by long hedges of Indian
fig trees and rows of dwarf palms, and dotted with
groves of pine and frequent orchards of fruit-bearing
trees; and at short intervals there are hills and
castles, roaring streams, the slender village belfries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
hidden among the trees, and the purple peaks of
distant mountains.</p>

<p>Most beautiful of all are the little country-houses
scattered along the road. I do not remember to
have seen a single one of them that was not as
white as snow. The house was white, the neighboring
well-curb was white, the little wall around
the kitchen-garden was white, as were also the two
posts of the garden-gate: everything seemed as if
it had been whitewashed the day before. Some of
these houses have one or two mullioned windows of
Moorish design; others have arabesques over the
door; and still others roofs covered with variegated
tiles like Arabian houses. Here and there through
the fields one sees the red-and-white capes of the
peasants, velvet hats against the green grass, and
sashes of all colors. The peasants whom one sees
in the furrows and those who run to see the train
pass are dressed in the costumes of forty years ago
as they are represented in paintings: they wear
velvet hats with very broad brims which roll
slightly back, with little crowns like a sugar-loaf;
short jackets, open waistcoats, breeches gathered in
at the knee like those of the priests, gaiters which
almost meet the breeches, and sashes around the
waist. This style of dress, picturesque but inconvenient,
is exceedingly becoming to the slender
figures of these men, who prefer discomfort, if it be
attended by beauty, to comfort without it, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
spend half an hour every morning adorning themselves,
besides the time required to get into a pair
of tight breeches which will display a shapely thigh
and a well-turned leg. They have nothing in common
with our Northern peasant of the hard face and
dull eye. Their great black eyes meet your own
with a smile, as if they would say, "Don't you
remember me?" They cast daring glances at the
ladies who put their heads out of the windows, run
to fetch a match before you have so much as asked
for it, sometimes answer your questions in rhyme,
and are even capable of laughing to show their
white teeth.</p>

<p>At Rinconado the campanile of the cathedral of
Seville comes into view in a line with the railroad,
and to the right, beyond the Guadalquivir, one sees
the beautiful low hills, covered with olive-groves, at
the foot of which lie the ruins of Italica. The train
rolled on, and I said to myself, under my breath,
speaking faster and faster as the houses became
thicker, with that suspense, full of longing and
delight, which one feels on approaching the doorway
of one's love, "Seville! this is Seville! The
queen of Andalusia is at hand, the Athens of Spain,
the mother of Murillo, the city of poets and lovers,
the storied Seville, whose name I have pronounced
from a child with a sentiment of loving sympathy!
What should I have given a few years since to have
seen it? No, it is not a dream! Those are really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
the houses of Seville; those peasants yonder are
Sevillians; that campanile which I see is the
Giralda! I am at Seville! How strange! It
makes me laugh! What is my mother doing at
this moment? Would that she were here! Would
that this friend and that were here! It is a sin to
be alone! See the white houses, the gardens, the
streets.... We are in the city.... It is time to
get out.... Ah! how beautiful is life!"</p>

<p>I went to a hotel, threw down my valise in the
<i>patio</i>, and began to stroll about the city. It seemed
like seeing Cordova over again, on a large scale,
embellished and enriched; the streets are wider, the
houses higher, the <i>patios</i> more spacious, but the general
appearance of the city is the same: there is the
same spotless white, the same intricate network of
streets, everywhere the fragrance of orange-blossoms,
that subtile air of mystery, that Oriental atmosphere,
filling one's heart with a delicious sense
of amorous melancholy, and calling to mind a thousand
fancies, desires, and visions of a distant world,
a new life, an unknown people, and an earthly paradise
of love, pleasure, and content. In those streets
one reads the history of the city: every balcony,
every fragment of sculpture, every lonely crossway,
recalls some nocturnal adventure of a king, the inspiration
of a poet, the romance of a beauty, an
amour, a duel, an abduction, a story, or a festival.
Here a memento of Maria de Padilla, there one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
Don Pedro; yonder of Cervantes, Columbus, Saint
Theresa, Velasquez, or Murillo. A column tells of
the Roman dominion; a tower, the splendor of
Charles V.'s monarchy; and an alcazar, the magnificence
of the Arabian court. Beside the modest
white cottages rise sumptuous marble palaces; the
little tortuous streets open into vast squares full of
orange trees; from silent, deserted corners one
enters with a short turn a street filled with a noisy
crowd: and wherever one passes one sees on the
opposite side the graceful lattices of the <i>patios</i>,
flowers, statues, fountains, flights of stairs, walls
covered with arabesques, small Moorish windows,
and slender columns of costly marble; and at every
window and in every garden little women clothed in
white, half hidden, like timid nymphs, among the
leaves of grapevines and rosebushes.</p>

<p>Passing from street to street, I came at length to
the bank of the Guadalquivir, close to the avenues
of the Christina promenade, which is to Seville what
the Lung d'arno is to Florence. Here one enjoys a
charming spectacle.</p>

<p>I first approached the famous Torre del Oro.
This famous tower was called the Golden, either
because it received the gold which the Spanish ships
brought from America or because King Don Pedro
hid his treasures there. It is an octagonal structure
of three stories, growing smaller as they ascend,
crowned with battlements and washed by the river.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
The story runs that this tower was built in Roman
times, and that for a long period the king's most
beautiful favorite dwelt there after it had been
joined to the Alcazar by an edifice which was torn
away to make room for the Christina promenade.</p>

<p>This promenade extends from the ducal palace of
Montpensier to the Torre del Oro. It is entirely
shaded with Oriental plane trees, oaks, cypresses,
willows, poplars, and other trees of northern latitudes,
which the Andalusians admire, as we admire
the palms and aloes of the plains of Piedmont and
Lombardy. A great bridge spans the river and
leads to the suburb of Triana, from which one sees
the first houses on the opposite bank. A long line
of ships, coasting vessels, and barges extends along
the river, and from the Torre del Oro to the ducal
palace there is a coming and going of rowboats.
The sun was setting. A crowd of ladies filled the
avenues, groups of workmen were crossing the
bridge, the workmen on the ships labored more
busily, a band of music was playing among the
trees, the river was rose-colored, the air was fragrant
with the perfume of flowers, the sky seemed
all on fire.</p>

<p>I returned to the city and enjoyed the marvellous
spectacle of Seville by night. All the <i>patios</i> were
illuminated&mdash;those of the humble houses with a half
light, which gave them an air of mysterious beauty,
those of the palaces, full of little flames which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
reflected in the mirrors and flashed like jets of quicksilver
in the spray of the fountains, and shone with
a thousand colors on the marbles of the vestibules,
the mosaics of the walls, the glass of the doors, and
the crystal of the candlesticks. Inside one saw a
crowd of ladies, everywhere one heard the sound of
laughter, low voices, and music; one seemed to be
passing through so many ball-rooms; from every
door flowed a stream of light, fragrance, and harmony;
the streets were crowded; among the trees
of the squares, in the avenues, at the end of the
narrow streets, and on the balconies,&mdash;everywhere
were seen white skirts fluttering, vanishing, and reappearing
in the darkness, and little heads ornamented
with flowers peeped coquettishly from the
windows; groups of young men broke through the
crowd with merry shouts; people called to each
other and talked from window to street, and everywhere
were rapid motion, shouting, laughter, and
festal gaiety. Seville was simply an immense garden
in which revelled a people intoxicated with
youth and love.</p>

<p>Such moments are very sad ones for a stranger.
I remember that I could have struck my head
against the wall. I wandered here and there almost
abashed, with hanging head and sad heart, as if all
that crowd was amusing itself for the sole purpose
of insulting my loneliness and melancholy. It was
too late to present my letters of introduction, too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
early to go to bed: I was the slave of that crowd
and that gaiety, and was obliged to endure it for
many hours. I found a solace in resolving not to
look at the faces of the women, but I could not
always keep my resolve, and when my eyes inadvertently
met two black pupils the wound, because
so unexpected, was more grievous than if I had encountered
the danger more boldly. Yes, I was
in the midst of those wonderfully famous women
of Seville! I saw them pass on the arms of their
husbands and lovers; I touched their dresses,
breathed their perfume, heard the sound of their
soft speech, and the blood leaped to my head like a
flame of fire. Fortunately, I remembered to have
heard from a Sevillian at Madrid that the Italian
consul was in the habit of spending the evening at
the shop of his son, a merchant; I sought out the
shop, entered, and found the consul, and as I handed
him a letter from a friend I said, with a dramatic air
which made him laugh, "Dear sir, protect me; Seville
has terrified me."</p>

<p>At midnight the appearance of the city was unchanged:
the crowd and light had not disappeared;
I returned to the hotel and locked my door with the
intention of going to bed. Worse and worse! The
windows of my room opened on a square where
crowds of people were swarming around an orchestra
that played without interruption, when the music
finally ended the guitars commenced, together with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
cries of the water-carriers and snatches of song and
laughter; the whole night through there was noise
enough to wake the dead. I had a dream at once
delightful and tantalizing, but rather more tantalizing
than delightful. I seemed to be tied to the bed by a
very long tress of dark hair twisted into a thousand
knots, and felt on my lips a mouth of burning coals
which sucked my breath, and around my neck two
vigorous little hands which were crushing my
head against the handle of a guitar.</p>

<p>The following morning I went at once to see the
cathedral.</p>

<p>To adequately describe this measureless edifice
one should have at hand a collection of the most
superlative adjectives and all the most extravagant
similes which have come from the pens of the grand
writers of every country whenever they have described
something of prodigious height, enormous
size, appalling depth, and incredible grandeur.
When I talk to my friends about it, I too, like the
Mirabeau of Victor Hugo, involuntarily make <i>un
colossal mouvement d'epaules</i>, puff out my throat,
and gradually raise my voice, like Tommaso Salvini
in the tragedy of <i>Samson</i> when, in tones which make
the parquet tremble, he says that he feels his strength
returning to his limbs. To talk of the cathedral of
Seville tires one like playing a great wind instrument
or carrying on a conversation across a roaring
torrent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>The cathedral of Seville stands alone in the centre
of a vast square, and consequently one can measure
its vastness at a single glance. At the first moment
I thought of the famous motto which the chapter of
the primitive church adopted on the eighth of July,
1401, when they decreed the erection of the new
cathedral: "Let us build a monument which will
make posterity declare that we were mad." Those
reverend canons did not fail in their intention. But
one must enter to be sure of this.</p>

<p>The exterior of the cathedral is grand and magnificent,
but not to be compared with the interior.
The faÃ§ade is lacking: a high wall surrounds the
entire building like a fortress. However much one
walks around and looks at it, one cannot succeed in
fixing in one's mind a single outline which, like the
preface of a book, will give a clear conception of the
design of the work; one admires and occasionally
breaks out in the exclamation, "It is stupendous!"
but it does not please, and one hurries into the
church, hoping to feel a sentiment of deeper admiration.</p>

<p>On first entering one is amazed, and feels as if
one were lost in an abyss, and for some moments the
eye can only describe immense curves through that
vast space, as if to assure you that the sight is real
and that fancy is not deceiving you. Then you approach
one of the pilasters, measure it, and look at
the others in the distance: they are as massive as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
towers, and yet they look so slender that one trembles
to think the edifice is resting on them. You
run from one to another with a rapid glance, follow
their lines from pavement to vaulted arch, and seem
to be able to count the moments which it would take
for the eye to climb them. There are five naves,
each of which would form a great church, and in the
central nave one could build another high cathedral
with its cupola and belfry. Altogether they form
sixty light, noble vaults which seem to be slowly
expanding and rising as one looks at them. Everything
in this cathedral is enormous. The great
chapel in the middle of the principal nave, so high
that it almost touches the roof, seems like a chapel
built for giant priests, to whose knees the common
altars would scarcely reach; the Easter candle
seems like the mast of a ship, the bronze candlestick
which supports it, like the pilaster of a church;
the organs are like houses; the choir is a museum
of sculpture and carving which alone deserves a
day's study. The chapels are worthy of the church:
in them are scattered the masterpieces of sixty-seven
sculptors and thirty-eight painters. Montegna,
Zurbaran, Murillo, Valdes, Herrera, Boldan, Roelas,
and Campana have left a thousand immortal traces
of their handiwork. The chapel of Saint Ferdinand,
which contains the tombs of this king, his
wife Beatrice, Alfonso the Wise, the celebrated
minister Florida Blanca, and other illustrious per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>sonages,
is one of the richest and most beautiful.
The body of King Ferdinand, who rescued Seville
from the dominion of the Arabs, clothed in his coat-of-mail
with crown and royal robe, rests in a crystal
casket covered with a pall; on one side lies the
sword which he wore on the day of his entrance into
Seville; on the other, the staff, an emblem of authority.
In this same chapel is preserved a little
ivory Virgin which the sainted king carried with
him to war, and other relics of great value. In the
other chapels there are great marble altars, Gothic
tombs, statues of stone, wood, and silver enclosed
in large glass cases, with the breast and hands
covered with diamonds and rubies; there are also
magnificent paintings, but, unfortunately, the dim
light which falls from the high windows does not
make them clear enough to be enjoyed in all their
beauty.</p>

<p>From the examination of the chapels, paintings,
and sculptures one returns unwearied to admire the
cathedral in its grand and, if one may say, its formidable
aspect. After climbing to those dizzy
heights one's glance and thoughts, as if exhausted
by the effort, fall back to the earth to gather new
strength for another ascent. And the images which
multiply in one's head correspond to the vastness of
the basilica&mdash;measureless angels, heads of enormous
cherubim, great wings like the sails of a ship, and
the fluttering of immense white robes. The impres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>sion
produced by this cathedral is wholly religious,
but it is not depressing: it is that sentiment which
bears the thought into interminable spaces and the
awful silences where the thoughts of Leopardi lost
themselves; it is a sentiment full of yearning and
holy boldness, that delightful shudder which one
feels on the brink of a precipice, the turbulence and
confusion of great thoughts, the divine fear of the
infinite.</p>

<p>As the cathedral is the most various of Spain
(since the Gothic, Germanic, GrÃ¦co-Roman, Moorish,
and, as it is vulgarly called, the plateresque
styles of architecture, have each left their individual
impress upon it), it is also the richest and has the
greatest privileges. In the times of greater clerical
power they burned in it every year twenty thousand
pounds of wax; in it every day were celebrated
five hundred masses on eighty altars; the wine consumed
in the sacrifice amounted to the incredible
quantity of eighteen thousand seven hundred and
fifty litres. The canons had trains of male attendants
like monarchs, came to church in splendid
carriages drawn by superb horses, and while they
were celebrating mass had priests to fan them with
enormous fans adorned with feathers and pearls&mdash;a
direct concession from the Pope of which some avail
themselves even in this day. One need not speak
of the festivals of Holy Week, which are still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
famous the world over, and to which people gather
from all parts of Europe.</p>

<p>But the most curious privilege of the cathedral
of Seville is the so-called dance <i>de los seises</i>, which
takes place every evening at dusk for eight consecutive
days after the festival of <i>Corpus Domini</i>.
I was in Seville during those days, and went to see
it, and it seems to me worth describing. From
what had been told me I expected to see a scandalous
piece of buffoonery, and entered the church
with my mind prepared for a feeling of indignation
at the desecration of the sanctuary. The church
was dark; only the great chapel was lighted; a
crowd of kneeling women filled the space between
the chapel and the choir. Some priests were sitting
to the right and left of the altar; in front of the
altar-steps was spread a great carpet; two lines of
boys from eight to thirteen years of age, dressed
like Spanish cavaliers of the Middle Ages, with
plumed hats and white stockings, were drawn up,
one before the other, facing the altar. At a signal
from a priest a soft strain from violins broke the
profound silence of the church, and the two rows of
boys advanced with the step of a contra-dance, and
began to divide, intermingle, separate, and come together
again with a thousand graceful movements, and
then all together they broke into a harmonious musical
chant, which echoed through the gloom of the
vast cathedral like the singing of an angelic choir;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and a moment later they began to accompany the
dance and the chant with tamborines. No religious
ceremony has ever moved me like this. It is impossible
to express the effect produced by those young
voices under those immense domes, those little
creatures at the foot of the towering altars, that
dance, solemn and almost humble, the ancient
costume, the kneeling crowd, and the surrounding
gloom. I left the church with my soul calmed as if
I had been praying.</p>

<p>A very curious anecdote is related in connection
with this ceremony. Two centuries ago an archbishop
of Seville, who regarded the dance and tamborines
as unworthy instruments of praising God,
wished to prohibit the ceremony. Everything was
thrown into confusion: the people protested; the
canons made themselves heard; the archbishop was
obliged to appeal to the Pope. The Pope, whose
curiosity was aroused, wished to see this silly dance
with his own eyes, that he might decide intelligently
in the matter. The boys in their cavalier dress
were taken to Rome, received at the Vatican, and
made to dance and sing before His Holiness. His
Holiness laughed, did not disapprove, and, wishing
to give one knock on the hoop and another on the
barrel, and so to satisfy the canons without offending
the archbishop, decreed that the boys should
continue to dance so long as the clothes which they
then wore lasted; after that time the ceremony was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
to be abolished. The archbishop laughed in his
beard, if he had one; the canons laughed too, as if
they had already found the way to outwit both the
Pope and the archbishop. And, in fact, they renew
some part of the boys' dress every year, so that the
whole garment can never be said to have worn out,
and the archbishop, as a scrupulous man, who observed
the commands of the Pope to the letter, could
not oppose the repetition of the ceremony. So they
continued to dance, and they dance and will dance
so long as it pleases the canons and the Lord.</p>

<p>As I was leaving the church a sacristan made me
a sign, led me behind the choir, and pointed out a
tablet in the pavement, upon which I read an inscription
which stirred my heart. Under that stone
lay the bones of Ferdinand Columbus, the son of
Christopher, who was born at Cordova, and died at
Seville on the twelfth of July, 1536, in the fiftieth
year of his age. Under the inscription run some
Latin verses with the following significance:</p>

<p>"Of what avail is it that I have bathed the entire
universe with my sweat, that I have three times passed
through the New World discovered by my father, that
I have adorned the banks of the gentle Beti, and preferred
my simple taste to riches, that I might again
draw around thee the divinities of the Castalian spring,
and offer thee the treasures already gathered by Ptolemy,&mdash;if
thou, passing this stone in silence, returnest
no salute to my father and givest no thought to me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>The sacristan, who knew more about the inscription
than I did, explained it to me. Ferdinand Columbus
was in his early youth a page of Isabella the
Catholic and of the prince Don Juan; he travelled
to the Indies with his father and his brother the admiral
Don Diego, followed the emperor Charles V.
in his wars, made other voyages to Asia, Africa, and
America, and everywhere collected with infinite care
and at great expense the most precious books, from
which he composed a library which passed after his
death into the hands of the chapter of the cathedral,
and remains intact under the famous name of the
Columbian Library. Before his death he wrote these
same Latin verses which are inscribed on the tablet
of his tomb, and expressed a desire to be buried in
the cathedral. In the last moments of his life he
had a vessel full of ashes brought to him and
sprinkled his face with them, pronouncing as he did
so the words of Holy Writ, <i>Memento homo quia pulvis
es</i>, chanted the <i>Te Deum</i>, smiled, and expired
with the serenity of a saint. I was at once seized
with a desire to visit the library and left the church.</p>

<p>A guide stopped me on the threshold to ask me if
I had seen the <i>Patio de los Naranjos</i>&mdash;the Court of
Oranges&mdash;and, as I had not done so, he conducted
me thither. The Court of Oranges lies to the north
of the cathedral, surrounded by a great embattled
wall. In the centre rises a fountain encircled by an
orange-grove, and on one side along the wall is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
marble pulpit, from which, according to the tradition,
Vincenzo Ferrer is said to have preached. In
the area of this court, which is very large, rose the
ancient mosque, which is thought to have been built
toward the end of the twelfth century. There is
not the least trace of it now. In the shade of the
orange trees around the margins of the basin the
good Sevillians come to take the air in the burning
noons of summer, and only the delightful verdure
and the perfumed air remain as memorials of the
voluptuous paradise of Mohammed, while now and
then a beautiful girl with great dark eyes darts between
the distant trees.</p>

<p>The famous Giralda of the cathedral of Seville is
an ancient Moorish tower, built, it is affirmed, in the
year one thousand after the design of the architect
Geber, the inventor of algebra. The upper part has
been changed since Spain was reconquered, and has
been rebuilt like a Christian bell-tower, but it will
always retain its Moorish appearance, and, after all,
is prouder of the banished standards of the vanquished
than of the cross recently planted upon it by
the victors. It is a monument which produces a
strange sensation: it makes one smile; it is measureless
and imposing as an Egyptian pyramid, and
at the same time light and graceful as a summer-house.
It is a square brick tower of a mellow rose-color,
unadorned to a certain height, and from that
point up ornamented with mullioned Moorish win<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>dows,
which appear here and there like the windows
of a house provided with balconies, and give it a
very beautiful appearance. From the platform, which
was formerly covered by a variegated roof surmounted
by an iron pole which supported four enormous golden
balls, now rises the Christian bell-tower in three
stories, the first of which is taken up by the bells,
the second is encircled by a balcony, and the third
consists of a sort of cupola upon which, like a
weather-vane, turns a colossal gilded statue which
represents Faith, with a palm in one hand and a
banner in the other. This statue is visible a long
distance from Seville, and flashes when the sun
strikes it like an enormous ruby in the crown of a
gigantic king, who sweeps with his glance the entire
valley of Andalusia.</p>

<p>I climbed all the way to the top, and was there
amply rewarded for the fatigue of the ascent. Seville,
all white like a city of marble, encircled by a
diadem of gardens, groves, and avenues, surrounded
by a landscape dotted with villas, lay open to the
view in all the wealth of its Oriental beauty. The
Guadalquivir, freighted with ships, divides and embraces
it in a majestic curve. Here the Torre del
Oro casts its graceful shadow on the azure waters
of the river; there the Alcazar rears its frowning
towers; yonder the gardens of Montpensier raise
above the roofs of the building an enormous mass of
verdure: one's glance penetrates the bull-ring, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
public gardens, the <i>patios</i> of the homes, the cloisters
of the churches, and all the streets which converge
toward the cathedral; in the distance appear the
villages of Santi Ponce, Algaba, and others which
whiten the slopes of the hills; to the right of the
Guadalquivir the great suburb of Triana; on one
side along the horizon the broken peaks of the Sierra
Morena; and in the opposite direction other mountains
enlivened by infinite azure tints; and over all
this marvellous panorama the clearest, most transparent,
and entrancing sky which has ever smiled
upon the face of man.</p>

<p>I descended from the Giralda and went to see the
Columbian Library, located in an old building beside
the Court of Oranges. After I had seen a collection
of missals, Bibles, and ancient manuscripts, one of
which is attributed to Alfonso the Wise, entitled
"The Book of the Treasure," written with the most
scrupulous care in the ancient Spanish language, I
saw&mdash;let me repeat it, I saw&mdash;I, with my own
moist eyes, as I pressed my hand on my beating
heart&mdash;I saw a book, a treatise on cosmography and
astronomy in Latin, with the margins covered with
notes written in the hand of Christopher Columbus!
He had studied that book while he revolved his
great design in his mind, had pored over its pages
in the night-watches, had touched it perhaps with
his divine forehead in those exhausting vigils when
sometimes he bent over the parchments with utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
weariness and bathed them with his sweat. It is a
tremendous thought! But there is something better.
I saw a writing in the hand of Columbus in which
are collected all the prophecies of the ancient
writers, sacred and profane, in regard to the discovery
of the New World, written, it is said, to induce
the sovereigns of Spain to provide the means
to carry out his enterprise. There is, among others,
a passage from the <i>Medea</i> of Seneca, which runs:
<i>Venient annis saecula seris, quibus oceanus vincula
rerum laxet et ingens pateat tellus</i>. And in the
volume of Seneca, which may also be found in the
Columbian Library, alongside of this passage there
is a note by Ferdinand Columbus, which says:
"This prophecy was fulfilled by my father, the
admiral Christopher Columbus, in the year 1492."
My eyes filled with tears; I wished I were alone,
that I might have kissed those books, have tired
myself out turning and re-turning their leaves between
my hands, have detached a tiny fragment,
and carried it with me as a sacred thing. Christopher
Columbus! I have seen his characters! I
have touched the leaves which he has touched! I
have felt him very near me! On leaving the library,
I know not why&mdash;I could have leaped into the
midst of the flames to rescue a child, I could have
stripped myself to clothe a beggar, I could joyfully
have made any sacrifice&mdash;I was so rich!</p>

<p>After the library the Alcazar, but before reaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
it, although it is in the same square as the cathedral,
I felt for the first time what the Andalusian sun is
like. Seville is the hottest city of Spain, it was the
hottest hour of the day, and I found myself in the
hottest part of the city; there was a flood of light;
not a door, not a window, was open, not a soul astir;
if I had been told that Seville was uninhabited, I
should have believed it. I crossed the square
slowly with half-shut eyes and wrinkled face, with
the sweat coursing in great drops down my cheeks
and breast, while my hands seemed to have been
dipped in a bucket of water. On nearing the
Alcazar I saw a sort of booth belonging to a water-carrier,
and dashed under it headlong, like a man
fleeing from a shower of stones. I took a little
breathing-spell, and went on toward the Alcazar.</p>

<p>The Alcazar, the ancient palace of the Moorish
kings, is one of the best-preserved monuments in
Spain. From the outside it looks like a fortress:
it is entirely surrounded by high walls, embattled
towers, and old houses, which form two spacious
courtyards in front of the faÃ§ade. The faÃ§ade is
bare and severe, like the rest of the exterior; the
gate is adorned with gilded and painted arabesques,
between which one sees a Gothic inscription which
refers to the time when the Alcazar was restored by
order of King Don Pedro. The Alcazar, in fact,
although a Moorish palace, is the work of Christian
rather than of Moorish kings. It is not known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
exactly in what year it was built: it was reconstructed
by King Abdelasio toward the end of the
twelfth century, conquered by King Ferdinand toward
the middle of the thirteenth century; altered
a second time, in the following century, by King Don
Pedro; and then occupied for longer or shorter
periods by nearly all the kings of Castile; and
finally selected by Charles V. as the place for the
celebration of his marriage with the infanta of
Portugal. The Alcazar has witnessed the loves
and crimes of three generations of kings; every
stone awakens a memory and guards a secret.</p>

<p>You enter, cross two or three rooms in which
there remains little of the Moorish excepting the
vaulted ceiling and the mosaics around the walls,
and come out into a court where you stand speechless
with wonder. A portico of very delicate arches
extends along the four sides, supported by slender
marble columns, joined two by two, and arches and
walls and windows and doors are covered with carvings,
mosaics, and arabesques most intricate and exquisite,
here perforated like lace, there closely
woven and elaborate like embroidered tapestry,
yonder clinging and projecting like masses and
garlands of flowers; and, except the mosaics, which
are of a thousand colors, everything is white, clean,
and smooth as ivory. On the four sides are four
great doors, through which you enter the royal
apartments. Here wonder becomes enchantment:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
whatever is richest, most various, and most splendid,
whatever the most ardent fancy sees in its most
ardent dreams, is to be found in these rooms. From
pavement to the vaulted ceiling, around the doors,
along the window-frames, in the most hidden corners,
wherever one's glance falls, one sees such a luxuriance
of ornaments in gold and precious stones, such
a close network of arabesques and inscriptions, such
a marvellous profusion of designs and colors, that
one has scarcely taken twenty steps before one is
amazed and confused, and the wearied eye wanders
here and there searching for a hand's breadth of
bare wall where it may flee and rest. In one of
these rooms the guide pointed out a red spot which
covered a good part of the marble pavement, and
said in a solemn voice, "These are the blood-stains
of Don Fadrique, grand master of the order of
Santiago, who was killed on this very spot, in the
year 1358, by order of his brother, King Don
Pedro."</p>

<p>I remember that when I heard these words I
looked in the face of the custodian, as if to say,
"Come, let us be going," and that good man answered
in a dry tone,</p>

<p>"<i>Caballero</i>, if I had told you to believe this thing
on my word, you would have had every reason to
doubt; but when you can see the thing with your
very eyes, I may be wrong, but&mdash;it seems to
me...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>"Yes," I hastened to say&mdash;"yes, it is blood: I
believe it, I see it; let's say no more about it."</p>

<p>But if one can be playful over the blood-spots,
one cannot be so over the story of the crime; the
sight of the place revives in the mind all the most
horrible details. Through the great gilded halls one
seems to hear the echo of Don Fadrique's footsteps,
followed by those of the bowmen armed with
bludgeons; the palace is immersed in gloom; one
hears no other sound save that of the executioners
and their victim; Don Fadrique tries to enter the
courtyard; Lopez de Padilla catches him; Fadrique
throws him off and is in the court; he grasps his
sword; curses on it! the cross of the hilt is held fast
in the mantle of the order of Santiago; the bowmen
gain upon him; he has not time to unsheath the
sword; he flees here and there, groping his way;
Fernandez de Roa overtakes him and fells him with
a blow of his club; the others run up and set upon
him, and Fadrique dies in a pool of blood....</p>

<p>But this sad recollection is lost among the thousand
images of the sensuous Moorish kings. Those
graceful little windows, where it seems as if you
ought to see every other moment the languid face
of an odalisque; those secret doors, at which you
pause in spite of yourself, as if you heard the rustle
of garments; those sleeping chambers of the sultans,
shrouded in mysterious gloom, where you seem to
hear only the confused amorous lament of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
maidens who there lost the flower of their virgin
purity; that prodigal variety of color and line, which
like a tumultuous and ever-changing harmony arouses
the senses to such fantastic flights that you doubt
whether you are waking or sleeping; that delicate
and lovely architecture, all of slender columns, that
seem like the arms of women; capricious arches,
little rooms, arched ceilings crowded with ornaments
hanging in the form of stalactites, icicles, and clusters
of grapes, of as many colors as a flower-garden;&mdash;all
this stirs your desire to sit down in the middle
of one of those rooms and to press to your heart a
lovely brown Andalusian head which will make you
forget the world and time, and, with one long kiss
that drinks away your life, give you eternal sleep.</p>

<p>On the ground floor the most beautiful room is the
Hall of the Ambassadors, formed by four great
arches which support a gallery with forty-four
smaller arches, and above a beautiful cupola carved,
painted, gilded, and chased with inimitable grace
and fabulous splendor.</p>

<p>On the upper floor, where were the winter apartments,
there remain only an oratory of Ferdinand
and Isabella the Catholic, and a little room in which
the king Don Pedro is said to have slept. From it
one descends by a narrow mysterious staircase to the
rooms where dwelt the famous Maria de Padilla, the
favorite of Don Pedro, whom popular tradition accuses
of instigating the king to kill his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>The gardens of the Alcazar are neither very large
nor particularly beautiful, but the memories which
they recall are of greater value than extent or
beauty. In the shade of those orange trees and
cypresses, to the murmur of those fountains, when
the great white moon was shining in that limpid Andalusian
sky, and the many groups of courtiers and
slaves rested there, how many long sighs of ardent
sultanas! how many lowly words from proud kings!
what passionate loves and embraces! "Itimad, my
love!" I murmured, thinking of the famous mistress
of King Al-Motamid as I wandered from path to
path as if following her phantom,&mdash;"Itimad," I repeated,
"do not leave me alone in this silent paradise!
Dost thou remember how thou camest to me?
Thy wealth of hair fell over my shoulder, and dearer
than the sword to the warrior wert thou to me! How
beautiful thou art! Thy neck is soft and white as
the swan's, and like berries are thy red, red lips!
How marvellous is the perfection of thy beauty!
How dear thou art, Itimad, my love! Thy kisses
are like wine, and thy eyes, like wine, steal away
my reason!"</p>

<p>While I was thus making my declarations of love
with phrases and images stolen from the Arabian
poets, at the very moment when I turned into a
bypath all bordered with flowers, suddenly I felt a
stream of water first on one leg and then on the
other. I jumped aside, and received a spray in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
face; I turned to the right, and felt another stream
against my neck; to the left, another jet between
my shoulders. I began to run: there was water
under me and around me in every direction, in jets,
streams, and spray; in a moment I was as wet as if
I had been dipped in the bath-tub. Just as I opened
my mouth to call for help it all subsided, and I heard
a ringing laugh at the end of the garden. I turned
and saw a young fellow leaning against a low wall
looking at me as if he were saying, "How did you
like it?" When I came out he showed me the
spring he had touched to play this little joke, and
comforted me with the assurance that the sun of Seville
would not leave me long in that dripping condition,
into which I had passed so rudely, alas!
from the lovely arms of my sultana.</p>

<p>That evening, in spite of the voluptuous images
which the Alcazar had called to my mind, I was sufficiently
calm to contemplate the beauty of the
women of Seville without fleeing to the arms of the
consul for safety. I do not believe that the women
of any other country are so bewitching as the fair
Andalusians, not only because they tempt one into
all sorts of mischief, but because they seem to have
been made to be seized and carried away, so small,
graceful, plump, elastic, and soft are they. Their
little feet could both be put easily into one's coat-pocket,
and with an arm one could lift them by the
waist like babies, and by the mere pressure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
finger could bend them like willow wands. To their
natural beauty they add the art of walking and looking
in a way to turn one's head. They fly along,
glide, and walk with a wave-like motion, and in a
single moment, as they pass, they show a little foot,
make you admire an arm or a slender waist, reveal
two rows of the whitest teeth, and dart at you a long
veiled glance that melts and dies in your own; and
on they go with an air of triumph, certain of having
turned your blood topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>To form an idea of the beauty of the women of
the people and the picturesqueness of their dress
you must go by day to visit the tobacco-manufactory,
which is one of the largest establishments of
the kind in Europe and employs not less than five
thousand hands. The building faces the vast gardens
of the duke of Montpensier: almost all of the
women work in three immense rooms, each divided
into three parts by as many rows of pillars. The
first view is astounding: there, all at once, eight
hundred girls present themselves before one's eyes
in groups of five or six, sitting around work-tables
as close as possible, the farthest indistinct and the
last scarcely visible; all of them young and a few
children&mdash;eight hundred jet-black heads and eight
hundred brown faces from every province of
Andalusia, from Jaen to Cadiz, from Granada to
Seville!</p>

<p>One hears a buzzing as of a square full of people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
The walls, from one door to the other, in all three
of the rooms are lined with skirts, shawls, kerchiefs,
and scarfs; and&mdash;a very curious thing&mdash;that entire
mass of garments, which would fill to overflowing a
hundred old-clothes shops, presents two predominant
colors, in two continuous lines one above the other,
like the stripes of a very long flag&mdash;the black of the
shawls above, and the red mixed with white, purple,
and yellow&mdash;so that one seems to see an immense
costumer's shop or an immense ball-room where the
ballet-dancers, in order to be free, have hung on the
walls every part of their dress which it is not absolutely
necessary to wear. The girls put on these
dresses when they go out, and wear old clothes to
work in; but white and red predominate in those
dresses also. The heat is insupportable, consequently
they lighten their clothing as much as possible,
and among those five thousand one will
scarcely find fifty whose arms and shoulders the
visitor may not contemplate at his pleasure, without
counting the extraordinary cases which present
themselves suddenly as one passes from room to
room, behind the doors and columns, and around the
distant corners. There are some very beautiful
faces, and even those who are not beautiful have
something about them which attracts one's glance
and lingers in the memory&mdash;the complexion, the
eyes, the brow, or the smile. Many of them,
especially so-called <i>Gitane</i>, are as dark as dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
mulattos and have protruding lips; others have eyes
so large that a faithful picture of them would be
considered a monstrous exaggeration; the greater
part are small and well-formed, and all have a rose
or carnation or some sort of wild flower in their
hair. They are paid in proportion to the work they
do, and the most skilful and industrious earn as
much as three francs per day; the lazy ones&mdash;<i>las
holgazanas</i>&mdash;sleep with their arms crossed on the
table and their heads resting on their arms; mothers
are working, and swinging a leg to which is bound
a cord that rocks the cradle. From the cigar-room
one passes to the cigarette-room, and from it to the
box-factory, and from the box-factory to the packing-room,
and in them all one sees the red skirts,
black hair, and fine eyes. In each of those rooms
how many stories of love, jealousy, despair, and
misery! On leaving the factory one seems for some
time to see black eyes in every direction regarding
him with a thousand varying expressions of curiosity,
indifference, sympathy, cheerfulness, sadness, and
drowsiness.</p>

<p>The same day I went to see the Museum of
Painting. The Seville gallery does not contain very
many paintings, but those few are worth a great
museum. There are the masterpieces of Murillo,
and among them his immortal <i>Saint Anthony of
Padua</i>, which is said to be the most divinely inspired
of his works, and one of the greatest achieve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>ments
of human genius. I visited the gallery
in the company of SeÃ±or Gonzalo Segovia and
Ardizone, one of the most illustrious young men
of Seville, and I wish he were here beside my table
at this moment to testify in a foot-note that when
my eyes first lit upon the picture I seized his arm
and uttered a cry.</p>

<p>Only once in my life have I felt such a profound
stirring of my soul as that which I felt on seeing
this picture. It was one beautiful summer night:
the sky was bright with stars, and the vast plain lay
extended before me from the high place where I
stood in deep silence. One of the noblest creatures
I have ever met in my life was at my side. A few
hours before we had been reading some pages from
one of Humboldt's works: we looked at the sky
and talked of the motion of the earth, the millions
of worlds, and the infinite with those suppressed
tones as of distant voices which one unconsciously
uses in speaking of such things in the silent night.
Finally we were still, and each, with eyes fixed on
the heavens, gave himself up to fancies. I know
not by what train of thought I was led; I know not
what mysterious chain of emotions was formed in
my heart; I know not what I saw or felt or dreamed.
I only know that suddenly a veil before my mind
seemed to be rent asunder; I felt within me a perfect
assurance of that which hitherto I had longed
for rather than believed; my heart expanded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
a feeling of supreme joy, angelic peace, and limitless
hope; a flood of scalding tears suddenly filled my
eyes, and, grasping the hand of my friend, which
sought my own, I cried from the depths of my soul,
"It is true! It is true!" and began to cry like a
child.</p>

<p>The <i>Saint Anthony of Padua</i> brought back the
emotions of that evening. The saint is kneeling in
the middle of his cell; the child Jesus in a nebulous
halo of white vaporous light, drawn by the power
of his prayer, is descending into his arms. Saint
Anthony, rapt in ecstasy, throws himself forward
with all his power of body and soul, his head thrown
back, radiant with an expression of supreme joy.
So great was the shock which this picture gave me
that when I had looked at it a few moments I was
as exhausted as if I had visited a vast gallery, and a
trembling seized me and continued so long as I
remained in that room.</p>

<p>Afterward I saw the other great paintings of
Murillo&mdash;a <i>Conception</i>, a <i>Saint Francis embracing
Christ</i>, another version of <i>Saint Anthony</i>, and others
to the number of twenty or more, among them the
famous and enchanting <i>Virgin of the Napkin</i>, painted
by Murillo upon a real napkin in the Capuchin convent
of Seville to gratify a desire of a lay brother
who was serving him: it is one of his most delicate
creations, in which is revealed all the magic of his
inimitable coloring&mdash;but none of these paintings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
although they are objects of wonder to all the artists
of the world, drew my heart or thoughts from that
divine <i>Saint Anthony</i>.</p>

<p>There are also in this gallery paintings by the two
Herreras, Pacheco, Alonzo Cano, Pablo de Cespedes,
Valdes, Mulato, a servant of Murillo who ably imitated
his style, and finally the large famous painting
of the <i>Apotheosis of Saint Thomas of Aquinas</i>, by
Francesco Zurbaran, one of the most eminent artists
of the seventeenth century, called the Spanish Caravaggio,
and possibly his superior in truth and
moral sentiment,&mdash;a powerful naturalist, a strong
colorist, and an inimitable painter of austere friars,
macerated saints, brooding hermits, and terrible
priests, and an unsurpassed poet of penitence, solitude,
and meditation.</p>

<p>After seeing the picture-gallery SeÃ±or Gonzalo
Segovia led me through a succession of narrow
streets to the street <i>Francos</i>, one of the principal
ways of the city, and stopped me in front of a little
draper's shop, saying with a laugh, "Look! Doesn't
this shop make you think of something?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," I replied.</p>

<p>"Look at the number."</p>

<p>"It is number fifteen: what of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! plague on it!" exclaimed my amiable guide,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"'Number fifteen,</div>
  <div class="verse">On the left-hand side'!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"The shop of the <i>Barber of Seville</i>!" I cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>"Precisely!" he responded&mdash;"the shop of the
Barber of Seville; but be on your guard when you
speak of it in Italy; do not take your oath, for traditions
are often misleading, and I would not assume
the responsibility of confirming a fact of such importance."</p>

<p>At that moment the merchant came to the door of
the shop, and, divining why we were there, laughed
and said, "<i>No esta</i>" ("Figaro is not here"), and
with a gracious bow he retired.</p>

<p>Then I besought SeÃ±or Gonzalo to show me a
<i>patio</i>, one of those enchanting <i>patios</i> which as I
looked at them from the street made me imagine so
many delightful things. "I want to see at least
one," I said to him&mdash;"to penetrate once into the
midst of those mysteries, to touch the walls, to
assure myself that it is a real thing and not a
vision."</p>

<p>My desire was at once fulfilled: we entered
the <i>patio</i> of one of his friends. SeÃ±or Gonzalo told
the servant the object of our visit, and we were
left alone. The house was only two stories in
height. The <i>patio</i> was no larger than an ordinary
room, but all marble and flowers, and a little fountain
in the middle, and paintings and statues around,
and from roof to roof an awning which sheltered it
from the sun. In a corner was a work-table, and
here and there one saw low chairs and little benches
whereon a few moments previously had doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
rested the feet of some fair Andalusian, who at that
moment was watching us from between the slats of a
blind. I examined everything minutely, as I would
have done in a house abandoned by the fairies: I sat
down, closed my eyes, imagined I was the master,
then arose, wet my hand with the spray of the
fountain, touched a slender column, went to the
door, picked a flower, raised my eyes to the windows,
laughed, sighed, and said, "How happy must
those be who live here!" At that moment I heard
a low laugh, and saw two great black eyes flash
behind a blind and instantly disappear. "Truly," I
said, "I did not believe that it was possible to still
live so poetically upon this earth. And to think
that you enjoy these houses all your life! and that
you have the inclination to rack your brains about
politics!"</p>

<p>SeÃ±or Gonzalo showed me the secrets of the
house. "All this furniture," said he, "these paintings,
and these vases of flowers disappear on the approach
of autumn and are taken to the second story,
which is the living apartment from autumn to
spring. When summer comes beds, wardrobes,
tables, chairs&mdash;everything is brought down to the
rooms on the ground floor, and here the family sleep
and eat, receive their friends, and do their work,
among the flowers and marbles to the murmur of
the fountain. And at night they have the doors
open, and from the sleeping-rooms one can see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
<i>patio</i> flooded with moonlight and smell the fragrance
of roses."</p>

<p>"Oh, stop!" I exclaimed, "stop, SeÃ±or Gonzalo!
Have pity on strangers!" And, laughing heartily,
we both went out on our way to see the famous <i>Casa
de Pilato</i>.</p>

<p>As we were passing along a lonely little street I
looked in a window of a hardware-shop and saw an
assortment of knives so long, broad, and unusual
that I felt a desire to buy one. I entered: twenty
were displayed before my eyes, and I had the salesman
to open them one by one. As each knife was
opened I took a step backward. I do not believe it
is possible to imagine an instrument more barbarous
and terrifying in appearance than one of them.
The handles are of wood, copper, and horn, curved
and carved in open patterns, so that one may see
through their little pieces of isinglass. The knives
open with a sound like a rattle, and out comes a
large blade as broad as the palm of your hand, as
long as both palms together, and as sharp as a
dagger, in the form of a fish, ornamented with red
inlaying, which suggests streaks of clotted blood,
and adorned with fierce and threatening inscriptions.
On the blade of one there will be written in Spanish,
<i>Do not open me without reason, nor shut me without
honor</i>; on another, <i>Where I strike, all is over</i>; on
a third, <i>When this snake bites, there is nothing left
for the doctor to do</i>; and other gallantries of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
same sort. The proper name of these knives is <i>navaja</i>&mdash;a
word which also has the meaning of razor&mdash;and
the <i>navaja</i> is the popular duelling weapon. Now
it has fallen into disuse, but was at one time held in
great honor; there were masters who taught its use,
each of whom had his secret blow, and duels were
fought in accordance with the rules of chivalry. I
bought the most terrible <i>navaja</i> in the shop, and we
entered the street again.</p>

<p>The <i>Casa de Pilato</i>, held by the Medina-Coeli
family, is, after the Alcazar, the most beautiful monument
of Moorish architecture in Seville. The name,
<i>Casa de Pilato</i>, comes from the fact that its founder,
Don Enriquez de Ribera, the first marquis of Tarifa,
had it built, as the story goes, in imitation of the
house of the Roman prÃ¦tor, which he had seen in
Jerusalem, where he went on a pilgrimage. The
edifice has a modest exterior, but the interior is marvellous.
One first enters a court not less beautiful
than the enchanting court of the Alcazar, encircled
by two orders of arches, supported by graceful
marble columns, forming two very light galleries, one
above the other, and so delicate that it seems as if
the first puff of wind would cast them into ruins.
In the centre is a lovely fountain resting on four
marble dolphins and crowned by a bust of Janus.
Around the lower part of the walls run brilliant
mosaics, and above these every sort of fantastic
arabesque, here and there framing beautiful niches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
containing busts of the Roman emperors. At the
four corners of the court the ceilings, the walls, and
the doors are carved, embroidered, and covered
with flowers and historic tapestries with the delicacy
of a miniature. In an old chapel, partly Moorish
and partly Gothic in style, and most delicate in form,
there is preserved a little column, scarcely more than
three feet in height, the gift of Pius V. to a descendant
of the founder of the palace, at one time viceroy
of Naples: to that column, says the tradition, was
bound Jesus of Nazareth to be scourged. This fact,
even if it were true, would prove that Pius V. did
not believe it in the slightest degree. For he would
not lightly have committed the unpardonable mistake
of depriving himself of a valuable relic to make a
present to the first comer. The entire palace is full
of sacred memories. On the first floor the custodian
points out a window which corresponds to that by
which Peter sat when he denied his Lord, and the
little window from which the maid-servant recognized
him. From the street one sees another window
with a little stone balcony, which represents the
exact position of the window where Jesus, wearing
the crown of thorns, was shown to the people.</p>

<p>The garden is full of fragments of ancient statuary
brought from Italy by that same Don Pedro Afan de
Ribera, viceroy of Naples. Among the other fables
that are told about this mysterious garden is one to
the effect that Don Pedro Afan de Ribera placed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
it an urn brought from Italy containing the ashes
of the emperor Trajan, and a curious person carelessly
struck the urn and overturned it; the emperor's
ashes were thus scattered over the grass, and
no one has ever succeeded in collecting them. So this
august monarch, born at Italica, by a very strange
fate has returned to the vicinity of his natal city,
not in the very best condition in which to meditate
upon its ruins, to tell the truth, but he was near it,
at any rate.</p>

<p>In spite of all that I have described, I may say
that I did not see Seville, but just commenced to see
it. Nevertheless, I shall stop here, because everything
must have an end. I pass by the promenaders,
the squares, the gates, the libraries, the public buildings,
the mansions of the grandees, the gardens and
the churches; but allow me to say that, after several
days' wandering through Seville from sunrise to sunset,
I was obliged to leave the city under the weight
of a self-accusing conscience. I did not know which
way to turn. I had reached such a condition of
weariness that the announcement of a new object to
be seen filled me with foreboding rather than pleasure.
The good SeÃ±or Gonzalo kept up my courage,
comforted me, and shortened the journeys with his
delightful company, but, nevertheless, I have only a
very confused remembrance of all that I saw during
those last days.</p>

<p>Seville, although it no longer merits the glorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
title of the Spanish Athens, as in the times of
Charles V. and Philip II., when it was mother and
patron of a large and chosen band of poets and
artists, the seat of culture and of the arts in the vast
empire of its monarchs, is even yet that one among
the cities of Spain, with the exception of Madrid, in
which the artistic life is most vigorously maintained,
as is evidenced by the number of its men of genius,
the liberality of its patrons, and the popular love of
the fine arts. It contains a flourishing academy of
literature, a society for the protection of the arts, a
well-known university, and a colony of scholars and
sculptors who enjoy an honorable distinction throughout
Spain. But the highest literary fame in Seville
belongs to a woman&mdash;Catharine Bohl, the author of
the novels which bear the name of Fernan Caballero,
widely read in Spain and America, translated into
almost all the languages of Europe, and known also
in Italy (where some of them were published not
long since) by every one who at all occupies himself
with foreign literature. They are admirable pictures
of Andalusian manners, full of truth, passion, and
grace, and, above all, possessing a vigor of faith and
a religious enthusiasm so fearless and a Christian
charity so broad that they would startle and confuse
the most skeptical man in the world. Catharine
Bohl is a woman who would undergo martyrdom
with the firmness and serenity of a Saint Ignatius.
The consciousness of her power is revealed in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
page: she does not hesitate to defend her religion,
and confronts, assails, threatens, and overthrows its
enemies; and not only the enemies of religion, but
every man and everything that, to use a common
expression, conforms to the spirit of the age, for
she never forgives the least sin which has been committed
from the times of the Inquisition to our own
day, and she is more inexorable than the Pope's syllabus.
And herein perhaps lies her greatest defect
as a writer&mdash;that her religious convictions and her
invectives are entirely too frequent and grow tiresome,
and disgust and prejudice the reader rather
than convince him of her own beliefs. But there is
not a shadow of bitterness in her heart, and as her
books, so is her life, noble, upright, and charitable.
In Seville she is revered as a saint. Born in that
city, she married early in life, and is now a widow
for the third time. Her last husband, who was
Spanish ambassador at London, committed suicide,
and from that day she has never laid aside her
mourning. At the time of my visit she was almost
seventy; she had been very beautiful, and her noble,
placid face still preserved the impress of beauty.
Her father, who was a man of considerable genius
and great culture, taught her several languages in
early life: she knows Latin thoroughly and speaks
Italian, German, and French with admirable facility.
At this time, however, she is not writing at all,
although the editors and publishers of Europe and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
America are offering her large sums for her works.
But she does not live a life of inactivity. From
morning to night she reads all sorts of books, and
while she reads she is either knitting or embroidering,
for she very firmly believes that her literary
studies ought not to take one minute from her feminine
employments. She has no children, and lives
in a lonely house, the best part of which has been
given to a poor family; she spends a great part of
her income in charity. A curious trait of her character
is her great love of animals: she has her
house full of birds, cats, and dogs, and her sensibilities
are so delicate that she has never consented
to enter a carriage, for fear of seeing the horse beaten
on her account. All suffering affects her as if she
herself were bearing it: the sight of a blind man or
of a sick person or of a cripple of any sort distresses
her for an entire day; she cannot close her eyes to
sleep unless she has wiped away a tear; she would
joyfully forego all her honors to save any unknown
person a heartache. Before the Revolution her life
was not so isolated: the Montpensier family received
her with great honor, and the most illustrious families
of Seville vied with each other in entertaining
her at their homes: now she lives only among her
books and a few friends.</p>

<p>In Moorish times Cordova took the lead in literature
and Seville in music. "When a scholar dies
at Seville," said Averroes, "and they wish to sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
his books, they send them to Cordova; but if a
musician dies at Cordova, they send his instruments
to Seville to be sold." Now Cordova has lost her
literary primacy, and Seville holds first place both
in literature and music. Truly the times are past
in which a poet by singing of the beauty of a maiden
draws around her a crowd of lovers from all parts
of the realm, and when one prince envies another
simply because a poet has sung in his praise a verse
more beautiful than any which the other had inspired,
and a caliph rewards the author of a noble
hymn by a gift of a hundred camels, a troop of
slaves, and a vase of gold&mdash;when a happy strophe
improvised at an opportune time releases a slave
from his chains or saves the life of one condemned
to death, and when the musicians are followed
through the streets of Seville by a train of monarchs,
and the favor of poets is more sought than that of
kings, and the lyre is more terrible than the sword.
But the people of Seville are always the most poetic
people of Spain. The <i>bon mot</i>, the word of love,
the expression of joy and enthusiasm, fly from their
lips with a fascinating spontaneity and grace. The
common people of Seville improvise, and talk as
though they are singing, gesticulate as if they are
declaiming, laugh and play like children. One
never grows old at Seville. It is a city where life
melts away in a continuous smile, with no other
thought than the enjoyment of the beautiful sky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
the lovely little houses, and the delightful little
gardens. It is the most peaceful city in Spain,
and the only one which since the Revolution has
not been agitated by those sad political commotions
which have stirred the others: politics do not penetrate
the surface; the Sevillians are content to make
love; all else they take in jest. <i>Todo lo toman de
broma</i>, say the other Spaniards of the Sevillians;
and in truth with that fragrant air, with those little
streets like those of an Oriental city, with those
fiery little women, why should they trouble themselves?
At Madrid they speak ill of them; they
say they are vain, false, fickle, and silly. It is
jealousy: they envy them their happy indolence,
the sympathy which they inspire in strangers, their
girls, their poets, their painters, their orators, their
Giralda, their Alcazar, their Guadalquivir, their
life, and their history. So say the Sevillians, striking
their breasts with one hand and puffing into the
air a cloud of smoke from the inseparable <i>cigaritto</i>;
and their lovely little women revenge themselves
upon their envious sisters and all the other women
in the world, speaking with spiteful pity of long feet,
large waists, and dull eyes, that in Andalusia would
not receive the honor of a glance or the homage of
a sigh. A charming and amiable people, in truth;
but, alas! one must look at the reverse side of the
medal: superstition reigns and schools are lacking,
as is the case throughout all Southern Spain; this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
is partly their own fault and partly not; but the
negative is probably the smaller part.</p>

<p>The day of my departure arrived unexpectedly.
It is strange: I remember scarcely any particulars
of my life at Seville; it is remarkable if I can tell
where I dined, what I talked about with the consul,
how I spent the evenings, and why I chose any
given day to take my departure. I was not myself;
I lived, if I may use the expression, out of myself;
all the while I remained in the city I was a little
dazed. Apart from the art-gallery and the <i>patio</i>
my friend Segovia must have found that I knew very
little; and now, I know not why, I think of those
days as of a dream. Of no other city are my recollections
so vague as of Seville. Even to-day, while
I am certain of having been at Saragossa, Madrid,
and Toledo, sometimes when I think of Seville a
doubt steals upon me. It seems to me like a city
much farther away than the most distant boundaries
of Spain, and that to journey there again I must
travel months and months, cross unknown continents
and wide seas, among people totally different from
our own. I think of the streets of Seville, of certain
little squares and certain houses, as I would think
of the spots on the moon. Sometimes the image of
that city passes before my eyes like a white figure,
and disappears almost before I can grasp it with my
mind&mdash;sometimes in a breath of air, at certain hours
of the day, at a garden-gate; in humming a song<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
which I heard a boy sing on the steps of the Giralda.
I cannot explain this secret to myself; I think of
Seville as of a city which I have still to see, and
I enjoy looking at the prints and thumbing the
books which I bought there, for they are tangible
things that convince me of my visit. A month ago
I received a letter from Segovia which said, "Come
back to us." It gave me untold pleasure, but at the
same time I laughed as if he had written, "Make a
voyage to Pekin." It is for this very reason that
Seville is dearer to me than all the other cities of
Spain; I love it as I might love a beautiful unknown
woman who, crossing a mysterious wood, might
look my way and throw me a flower. How often in
the theatre or at the cafÃ©, when a friend shakes me
and asks, "What are you thinking about?" I am
obliged to leave the little room of Maria de Padilla
to return to him, or a boat that is gliding along in
the shade of the Christina plane trees, or Figaro's
shop, or the vestibule of a <i>patio</i> full of flowers,
fountains, and lights.</p>

<p>I embarked on a boat of the Segovia Company,
near the Torre del Oro, at an hour when Seville is
wrapped in deep sleep and a burning sun covers it
with a flood of light. I remember that a few
moments before the boat started a young man came
on board in search of me, and gave me a letter from
Gonzalo Segovia, containing a sonnet which I still
cherish as one of my most precious mementos of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Seville. On the boat there was a company of Spanish
singers, an English family, some laboring-men,
and babies. The captain, being a good Andalusian,
had a cheery word for everybody. I soon began a
conversation with him. My friend Gonzalo was a
son of the proprietor of the line, and we talked of
the Segovia family, of Seville, the sea, and a thousand
pleasant things. Ah! the poor man was far
from thinking that a few days later the unlucky ship
would founder in the midst of the sea and bring him
to such a terrible end! It was the <i>Guadaira</i>, that
was lost a short distance from Marseilles by the
bursting of the boiler on the sixteenth day of June,
1872.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the boat started for Cadiz.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CADIZ" id="CADIZ"></a>CADIZ.</h2>


<p>That was the most delightful evening of all my
journey.</p>

<p>A little while after the ship had commenced to
move there sprang up one of those gentle breezes
which played with one as an infant plays with one's
cravat or a lock of one's hair, and from stem to
stern there was a sound of the voices of women and
children, like that which one hears among a group
of friends at the first crack of the whip announcing
their departure for a merry outing. All the passengers
gathered at the stern in the shade of a gayly-colored
awning like a Chinese pavilion: some were
sitting on coils of rope, others were stretched at full
length on the benches, others were leaning against
the rail&mdash;every one looked back in the direction of
the Torre del Oro to enjoy the famous and enchanting
spectacle of Seville as it faded away in the distance.
Some of the women had not yet dried the
tears of parting, and some of the children were still
a little frightened by the sound of the engine. And
some ladies were still quarrelling with the porters
for abusing their baggage; but in a few moments
all was serene again, and the passengers began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
peel oranges, light cigars, pass little flasks of liquor,
converse with their unknown neighbors, sing and
laugh, and in a quarter of an hour we were all
friends.</p>

<p>The boat glided along as smoothly as a gondola
over the still, limpid waters, which reflected the
white dresses of the ladies like a mirror, and the
breeze brought the delightful fragrance from the
orange-groves of the villas scattered along the shore.
Seville was hidden behind her circle of gardens, and
we saw only an immense mass of trees of vivid
green, and above them the black pile of the cathedral
and the rose-colored Giralda surmounted by
its statue flaming like a tongue of fire. As the
distance widened the cathedral appeared grander and
more majestic, as if it were following the vessel and
gaining upon her: now, although still following, it
seemed to retire a great way from the shore; now it
would seem to be spanning the river; one moment
it would appear suddenly to return to its place; a
moment later it looked so close that we suspected
the boat had turned back. The Guadalquivir
wound along in short curves, and as the boat turned
this way and that Seville appeared and disappeared,
now peeping out in one place as if it had stolen
beyond its boundaries, now raising its head suddenly
behind a wood, gleaming like a snowclad mountain,
now revealing some white streaks here and there
amid the verdure, and suddenly disappearing from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
view and performing all sorts of fantastic wiles, like
a coquettish woman. Finally it disappeared and we
saw it no more: the cathedral alone remained. Then
every one turned to look at the shore. We seemed
to be sailing on the lake of a garden. Here was a
hillside clothed with cypresses, here a hilltop all
covered with flowers, yonder a village extending
along the shore, and under the garden trellises
and along the terraces of the villas sat ladies looking
at us with spy-glasses; and here and there
were peasants' families in brightly-colored dresses,
sail-boats; and naked boys who plunged into the
water and turned sommersaults, frisked about,
shouted, and waved their hands toward the ladies
on the boat, who covered their faces with their fans.
Some miles from Seville we met three steamboats,
one after the other. The first came upon us so suddenly
at a turn of the river that, having had no
experience in that sort of navigation, I was afraid,
for a moment, that we should not have time to avoid
a collision; the two boats almost grazed each other
in passing, and the passengers of each saluted each
other and threw across oranges and cigars, and
charged each other with messages to be borne to
Cadiz or Seville.</p>

<p>My fellow-voyagers were almost all Andalusians,
and so, after an hour of conversation, I knew them
from first to last as well as if we had all been friends
from infancy. Every one instantly told every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
else, whether he wanted to know it or not, who he
was, his age, occupation, and where he was going,
and one even went so far as to tell how many sweethearts
he had and how many pesetas were in his
purse. I was taken for a singer; and this is not
strange if one considers that in Spain the people
think three-fourths of the Italians are trained to
sing, dance, or declaim. One gentleman, noticing
that I had an Italian book in my hand, asked me,
point-blank, "Where did you leave the company?"</p>

<p>"What company?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Weren't you singing with Fricci at the Zarzuela?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but I have never appeared on the
stage."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say, then, that you and the second
tenor look as much alike as two drops of water."</p>

<p>"You don't say so?"</p>

<p>"Pray excuse me."</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence."</p>

<p>"But you are an Italian?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you sing?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but I do not sing."</p>

<p>"How strange! To judge by your throat and
breast, I should have said that you must have a
splendid tenor voice."</p>

<p>I put my hand to my chest and neck, and replied,
"It may be so; I will try&mdash;one never knows. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
have two of the necessary qualifications: I am an
Italian and have the throat of a tenor; the voice
ought to follow."</p>

<p>At this point the prima donna of the company,
who had overheard the dialogue, entered the conversation,
and after her the entire company:</p>

<p>"Is the gentleman an Italian?"</p>

<p>"At your service, madam."</p>

<p>"I ask the question because I wish him to do me
a favor. What is the meaning of those short verses
from <i>Il Trovatore</i> which run&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent4">"Non puÃ² nemmeno un Dio</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">Donna rapirti a me."</div>
  <div class="verse">(Not even a god can steal my lady from me.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Is the lady married?"</p>

<p>They all began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the prima donna; "but why do
you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Because ... 'not even a god can steal you
from me' is what your husband ought to say, if he
has two good eyes in his head, every morning when
he rises and every night when he goes to bed."</p>

<p>The others laughed, but to the prima donna this
imaginary presumption on the part of her husband
in affirming that he was secure even against a god
seemed too extravagant, possibly because she knew
that she had not always been sufficiently wary in her
regard for men; and so she scarcely deigned by so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
much as a smile to show that she had understood
my compliment. She at once asked the meaning of
another verse, and after her the baritone, and after
the baritone the tenor, and after the tenor the second
lady, and so on, until for a little while I did nothing
but translate poor Italian verses into worse Spanish
prose, to the great satisfaction of some of them, who
for the first time were able to repeat intelligently a
little of what they had so often sung with an air of
perfect knowledge. When every one had learned as
much as he wished to know, the conversation came
to a close, and I stood talking a little while with the
baritone, who hummed me an air from the <i>Zarzuela</i>;
then I attached myself to one of the chorus, who
told me that the tenor was making love to the
prima donna; then I went off with the tenor, who
told me about the baritone's wife; then I talked
with the prima donna, who said disagreeable things
about the whole company; but they were all good
friends, and when they met, as they walked about
the boat and gathered under the awning, the men
pulled each other's beards and the women kissed
each other, and one and all exchanged glances and
smiles which revealed secret understandings. Some
ran through the gamut here, some hummed yonder,
others practised trills in a corner, and others again
tried a guttural <i>do</i> that ended in a wheezing sound
in the throat; and meanwhile they all talked at once
about a thousand trifles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>Finally, the bell sounded and we rushed headlong
to the table, like so many officials invited to a spread
at the unveiling of a monument. At this dinner,
amid the cries and songs of all those people, I drank
for the first time an unmixed glass of that terrible
wine of Xeres whose wonders are sung in the four
corners of the earth. I had scarcely swallowed it
before I seemed to feel a spark run through all my
veins, and my head burned as if it was full of sulphur.
All the others drank, and all were filled with
unrestrained mirth and became irresistibly loquacious;
the prima donna began to talk in Italian, the
tenor in French, the baritone in Portuguese, the
others in dialect, and I in every tongue; and there
were toasts and snatches of song, shouts, arch
glances, clasping of hands above table and the
kicking of feet below, and declarations of good fellowship
exchanged on all sides, like the personalities
in Parliament when the opposing factions join battle.
After dinner we all went on deck, flushed and in
great spirits, breathless and enveloped in a cloud of
smoke from our cigarettes, and then, in the light of
the moon, whose silvery rays gleamed on the wide
river and covered the hillsides and the groves with
limpid light, we began again a noisy conversation,
and after the conversation there was singing, not
only the trifling airs of <i>Zarzuela</i>, but passages from
operas, with solos, duets, trios, and choruses, with
appropriate gestures and stage strides, diversified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
with declamations from the poets, stories, and anecdotes,
hearty laughter, and tumultuous applause;
finally, tired and breathless, we were all silent, and
some fell asleep with upturned faces, others went to
lie down under cover, and the prima donna seated
herself in a corner to look at the moon. The tenor
was snoring. I profited by the occasion to go and
have an aria from the <i>Zarzuela</i>&mdash;<i>El Sargento Federico</i>&mdash;sung
to me in a low voice. The courteous
Andalusian did not wait to be pressed: she sang,
but suddenly she was silent and hid her face. I
looked at her: she was weeping. I asked her the
cause of her distress, and she answered, sadly, "I
am thinking of a perjury." Then she broke into
a laugh and began to sing again. She had a melodious,
flexible voice, and sang with a feeling of
gentle sadness. The sky was all studded with stars,
and the boat glided so smoothly through the water
that it scarcely seemed to be moving; and I thought
of the gardens of Seville, of the near African shore,
and of the dear one waiting for me in Italy, and my
eyes too were wet, and when the lady stopped singing,
I said, "Sing on, for&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">'Mortal tongue cannot express</div>
  <div class="verse">That which I felt within my breast....'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At dawn the boat was just entering the ocean;
the river was very wide. The right bank, scarcely
visible in the distance, stretched along like a tongue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
of land, beyond which shone the waters of the sea.
A moment later the sun rose above the horizon, and
the vessel left the river. Then there unfolded before
my eyes a sight that could not be described if
it were possible to join poetry, painting, and music
in one supreme art&mdash;a spectacle whose magnificence
and enchantment I believe not even Dante could
describe with his grandest images, nor Titian with
his most brilliant colors, nor Rossini with his most
perfect harmonies, nor even all three of them together.
The sky was a miracle of sapphire light
unflecked by a cloud, and the sea was so beautiful
that it seemed like an immense carpet of shimmering
silk; the sun was shining on the crests of the little
ripples caused by a light breeze, and it seemed as
if they were tipped with amethyst. The sea was
full of reflections and luminous bands of light, and
in the distance were streaks of silver, with here and
there great white sails, like the trailing wings of
gigantic fallen angels. I have never seen such
brilliancy of color, such splendor of light, such
freshness, such transparency, such limpid water and
sky. It seemed like a daybreak of creation, which
the fancy of poets had pictured so pure and effulgent
that our dawns are only pale reflections in comparison.
It was more than Nature's awakening and
the recurring stir of life: it was a hallelujah, a
triumph, a new birth of creation, growing into the
infinite by a second inspiration of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>I went below deck to get my spyglass, and when
I returned Cadiz was in sight.</p>

<p>The first impression which it made upon me was
a feeling of doubt whether it was a city or not. I
first laughed, then turned toward my fellow-traveller
with the air of one seeking to be assured that he is
not deceived. Cadiz is like an island of chalk. It
is a great white spot in the midst of the sea, without
a cloud, without a black line, without a shadow&mdash;a
white spot as clear and pure as a hilltop covered
with untrodden snow, standing out against a sky of
beryl and turquoise in the midst of a vast flooded
plain. A long, narrow neck of land unites it to the
continent; on all other sides it is surrounded by the
sea, like a boat just ready to sail bound to the shore
only by a cable. As we approached, the forms of
the campaniles, the outlines of the houses, and the
openings of the streets became clear, and everything
seemed whiter, and, however much I looked through
my spyglass, I could not have discovered the
smallest spot in that whiteness, either on a building
near the harbor or in the farthest suburbs. We
entered the port, where there were but a few ships
and those a great way apart. I stepped into a boat
without even taking my valise with me, for I was
obliged to leave for Malaga that same evening, and
so eager was I to see the city that when the boat
came to the bank, I jumped too soon and fell to the
ground like a corpse, although, alas! I still felt the
pains of a living body.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><i><a id="Cadiz_p"></a>Cadiz</i></div>
<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b158ct.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>Cadiz is the whitest city in the world; and it is
of no use to contradict me by saying that I have
not seen every other city, for my common sense
tells me that a city whiter than this, which is superlatively
and perfectly white, cannot exist. Cordova
and Seville cannot be compared with Cadiz:
they are as white as a sheet, but Cadiz is as white
as milk. To give an idea of it, one could not do
better than to write the word "white" a thousand
times with a white pencil on blue paper, and make
a note on the margin: "Impressions of Cadiz."
Cadiz is one of the most extravagant and graceful
of human caprices: not only the outer walls of the
houses are white, but the stairs are white, the courts
are white, the shop-walls are white, the stones are
white, the pilasters are white, the most secret and
darkest corners of the poorest houses and the loneliest
streets are white; everything is white from
roof to cellar wherever the tip of a brush can enter,
even to the holes, cracks, and birds' nests. In every
house there is a pile of chalk and lime, and every
time the eagle eye of the inmates spies the least
spot the brush is seized and the spot covered.
Servants are not taken into families unless they
know how to whitewash. A pencil-scratch on a
wall is a scandalous thing, an outrage upon the
public peace, an act of vandalism: you might walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
through the entire city, look behind all the doors,
and poke your nose into the very holes, and you
would find white, only and always and eternally.</p>

<p>But, for all this, Cadiz does not in the least resemble
the other Andalusian cities. Its streets are
long and straight, and the houses are high, and lack
the <i>patios</i> of Cordova and Seville. But, although
the appearance is different, the city does not appear
less interesting and pleasant to the eye of the
stranger. The streets are straight, but narrow, and,
moreover, they are very long, and many of them
cross the entire city, and so one can see at the end,
as through the crack in a door, a slender strip of
sky, which makes it seem as if the city was built on
the summit of a mountain cut on all sides in regular
channels: moreover, the houses have a great many
windows, and, as at Burgos, every window is provided
with a sort of glass balcony which rises in
tiers from story to story, so that in many streets the
houses are completely covered with glass, and one
sees scarcely any traces of the walls. It seems like
walking through a passage in an immense museum.
Here and there, between one house and the next,
rise the graceful fronds of a palm; in every square
there is a luxuriant mass of verdure, and at all the
windows bunches of grass and bouquets of flowers.</p>

<p>Really, I had been far from imagining that Cadiz
could be so gay and smiling&mdash;that terrible, ill-fated
Cadiz, burned by the English in the sixteenth cen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>tury,
bombarded at the end of the eighteenth, devastated
by the pestilence, hostess of the fleets of Trafalgar,
the seat of the revolutionary council during
the War of Independence, the theatre of the horrible
butchery of the Revolution of 1820, the target
of the French bombs in 1823, the standard-bearer
of the Revolution which hurled the Bourbons from
the throne,&mdash;Cadiz always restless and turbulent and
first of all to raise the battle-cry. But of such
calamities and such struggles there remain only
some cannon-balls half buried in the walls, for over
all the traces of destruction has passed the inexorable
brush, covering every dishonor with a white veil.
And as it is with the latest wars, so too there remains
not a trace of the PhÅ“nicians who founded
the city, nor of the Carthaginians and Romans who
enlarged and beautified it, unless one wishes to consider
as a trace the tradition which says, "Here rose
a temple to Hercules," "There rose a temple to
Saturn." But time has done a worse thing than to
deprive Cadiz of her ancient monuments: it has
stolen away her commerce and her riches since
Spain lost her possessions in America, and now Cadiz
lies there inert on her solitary rock, waiting in
vain for the thousand ships which once came with
flags and festoons to offer her the tribute of the
New World.</p>

<p>I had a letter of introduction to the Italian consul,
and after receiving it he courteously took me to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
top of a tower from which I was able to get a bird's-eye
view of the city. It was a novel sight and a
very lively surprise: seen from above, Cadiz is
white, entirely and perfectly white, just as it appears
from the sea; there is not a roof in all the
city; every house is covered on top by a terrace
surrounded by a low whitewashed wall; on almost
every terrace rises a little white tower, which is surmounted,
in its turn, by another smaller terrace or
by a little cupola or sort of sentry-box: everything
is white; all these little cupolas, these pinnacles,
and these towers, which give the city a very odd
and uneven appearance, gleam and stand out white
against the vivid blue of the sea. One's view extends
over the entire length of the isthmus which
connects Cadiz to the main land, embraces a far-off
strip of distant coast whitened by the cities of
Puerto Real and Puerto Santa Maria, dotted with villages,
churches, and villas, and includes also the port
and the clear and a very beautiful sky which vies
with the sea in transparency and light. I could not
look enough at that strange city. On closing my
eyes it appeared as if covered by an immense sheet.
Every house seemed to have been built for an astronomical
observatory. The entire population, in
case the sea should inundate the city, as in ancient
times, might gather on the terraces and remain there
in perfect ease, saving the fright.</p>

<p>I was told that a few years ago, on the occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
of some eclipse of the sun, this very spectacle was
witnessed: the seventy thousand inhabitants of Cadiz
all ascended to the terraces to watch the phenomenon.
The city changed its perfect whiteness for
a thousand colors; every terrace was thick with heads;
one saw at a single glance, quarter after quarter, and
finally the entire population: a low murmur rose to
heaven like the roar of the sea, and a great movement
of arms, fans, and spy-glasses, pointing upward,
made it seem as if the people were awaiting the
descent of some angel from the solar sphere. At a
certain moment there was a profound silence: when
the phenomenon was over the entire population gave
a shout, which sounded like a clap of thunder, and
a few moments later the city was white again.</p>

<p>I descended from the tower and went to see the
cathedral, a vast marble edifice of the sixteenth century,
not to be compared to the cathedrals of Burgos
and Toledo, but nevertheless dignified and bold in
architecture and enriched by every sort of treasure,
like all the other Spanish churches. I went to see
the convent where Murillo was painting a picture
over a high altar when he fell from the scaffold and
received the wound which caused his death. I
passed through the picture-gallery, which contains
some fine paintings of Zurbaran; entered the bull-ring,
built entirely of wood, which was created in a
few days to provide a spectacle for Queen Isabella.
Toward evening I took a turn in the delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
promenade along the sea-shore, in the midst of
orange trees and palms, where the most beautiful
and elegant ladies of the city were pointed out to
me, one by one. Whatever may be the judgment
of the Spaniards, to me the feminine type of Cadiz
did not seem at all inferior to the celebrated type
of Seville. The women are a little taller, a little
heavier, and are somewhat darker. Some observer
has ventured to say that they closely resemble the
Grecian type, but I do not know in what respect.
I saw no difference from the Andalusian type except
in stature, and that was enough to make me heave
sighs which might have propelled a ship, and constrained
me to return as soon as possible to the vessel
as a place of refuge and peace.</p>

<p>When I arrived on board it was night; the sky
was all twinkling with stars, and the breeze bore
faintly to my ears the music of a band playing on
the promenade of Cadiz. The singers were asleep;
I was alone, and the sight of the city lights and the
recollection of the lovely faces filled me with melancholy.
I did not know what to do with myself, so I
went down to the cabin, took out my note-book, and
commenced the description of Cadiz. But I only
succeeded in writing ten times the words, "White,
blue, snow, brightness, colors," after which I made a
little sketch of a woman and then closed my eyes
and dreamed of Italy.</p>

<h2><a name="MALAGA" id="MALAGA"></a>MALAGA.</h2>


<p>The next day, at sunset, the vessel was passing
through the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Now, as I look at that point on the map, it seems
so near home that when I am in the humor and my
domestic finances permit I ought not to hesitate a
moment to pack my valise and run down to Genoa
on my way to enjoy a second time the most beautiful
sight of two continents. But then it seemed to
be so far away that when I had written a letter to
my mother on the rail of the ship, intending to give
it to one of the passengers for Gibraltar to post, as I
was writing the address I laughed at my confidence,
as if it were impossible for a letter to travel all the
way to Turin. "From here!" I thought&mdash;"from
the Pillars of Hercules!" and I pronounced the Pillars
of Hercules as if I had said the Cape of Good
Hope or Japan.</p>

<p>"... I am on the ship Guadaira: behind me is
the ocean, and in front the Mediterranean, on the
left Europe and on the right Africa. On this side
I see the cape of Tarifa, and on that the mountains
of the African coast, which look indistinct like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
gray cloud; I see Ceuta, and a little beyond it
Tangiers like a white spot, and in a direct line with
the ship rises the Rock of Gibraltar. The sea is as
placid as a lake, and the sky is red and gold; all is
serene, beautiful, and magnificent, and I feel in my
mind an inexpressible and delightful stirring of
great thoughts, which, if I could put them into
words, would become a joyful prayer beginning and
ending with thy name...."</p>

<p>The vessel stopped in the Gulf of Algeciras: the
entire company of singers got into a large boat
from Gibraltar, and went off, waving fans and handkerchiefs
as a parting salute. It was growing dark
when the boat started again. Then I was able to
measure the enormous mass of the Rock of Gibraltar
at every turn. At first I thought we should leave
it behind in a few moments, but the moments became
hours. Gradually, as we approached, it towered
above us, and presented a new appearance every instant&mdash;now
the silhouette of some measureless monster,
now the image of an immense staircase, now
the outline of a fantastic castle, now a shapeless
mass like a monstrous aÃ«rolite fallen from a world
shivered in a battle of the spheres. Then, on nearer
view, behind a high rock like an Egyptian pyramid,
there came into sight a great projection as large as
a mountain, with fissures and broken boulders and
vast curves which lost themselves in the plain. It
was night; the rock stood outlined against the moon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>lit
sky as clear and sharp as a sheet of black paper
on a pane of glass. One saw the lighted windows
of the English barracks, the sentry-boxes on the
summit of the dizzy crags, and a dim outline of
trees which seemed little larger than a tuft of grass
among the nearest rocks. For a long time the boat
seemed motionless or else the rock was receding, so
close and threatening did it always appear; then,
little by little, it began to diminish, but our eyes
were weary of gazing before the rock grew weary
of threatening us with its fantastic transformations.
At midnight I gave a final salute to that formidable,
lifeless sentinel of Europe, and went to wrap myself
up in my little corner.</p>

<p>At break of day I awoke a few miles from the
port of Malaga.</p>

<p>The city of Malaga, seen from the port, presents
a pleasing appearance not wholly without grandeur.
On the right is a high rocky mountain, upon the top
of which and down one side, even to the plain, are
the enormous blackened ruins of the castle of Gibralfaro,
and on the lower slopes stands the cathedral
towering majestically above all the surrounding
buildings, lifting toward heaven, as an inspired poet
might say, two beautiful towers and a very high
belfry. Between the castle and the church and on
the face and sides of the mountain there is a mass&mdash;a
<i>canaille</i>, as Victor Hugo would say&mdash;of smoky
little houses, placed confusedly one above the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
as if they had been thrown down from above like
stones. To the left of the cathedral, along the shore,
is a row of houses, gray, violet, or pale yellow in
color, with white window-and door-frames, that
suggest the villages along the Ligurian Riviera.
Beyond rises a circle of green and reddish hills enclosing
the city like the walls of an amphitheatre,
and to the right and left along the sea-shore extend
other mountains, hills, and rocks as far as the eye
can see. The port was almost deserted, the shore
silent, and the sky very blue.</p>

<p>Before landing I took my leave of the captain,
who was going on to Marseilles, said good-bye to
the boatswain and passengers, telling them all that I
should arrive at Valencia a day ahead of the boat,
and I should certainly join them again and go on to
Barcelona and Marseilles, and the captain replied,
"We shall look for you," and the steward promised
that my place should be saved for me. How often
since then have I remembered the last words of those
poor people!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><i><a id="Malaga_p"></a>Malaga</i></div>
<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b170cs.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p>I stopped at Malaga with the intention of leaving
that same evening for Granada. The city itself
offers nothing worthy of note, excepting the new
part, which occupies a tract of land formerly
covered by the sea. This is built up in the modern
style, with wide, straight streets and large, bare
houses. The rest of the city is a labyrinth of narrow,
winding streets and a mass of houses without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
color, without <i>patios</i>, and without grace. There are
some spacious squares with gardens and fountains;
columns and arches of Moorish buildings, no modern
monuments; a great deal of dirt, and not a great
many people. The environs are very beautiful, and
the climate is milder than that of Seville.</p>

<p>I had a friend at Malaga, and after finding him
we passed the day together. He told me a curious
fact: At Malaga there is a literary academy of more
than eight hundred members, where they celebrate
the birthdays of all the great writers, and hold twice
a week a public lecture on some subject connected
with literature or science. That same evening they
were to celebrate a solemn function. Some months
earlier the academy had offered a prize of three
golden flowers, enamelled in different colors, to the
three poets who should compose the best ode on
"Progress," the best ballad on the "Recovery of
Malaga," and the best satire on one of the most prevalent
vices of modern society. The invitation had
been extended to all the poets of Spain; poems had
poured in in abundance; a board of judges had secretly
considered them; and that very evening the choice
was to be announced. The ceremony was to be
conducted with great pomp. The bishop, the governor,
the admiral, the most conspicuous personages
of the city, with dress-coats, orders, and shoulder-scarfs,
and a great number of ladies in evening dress,
were to be present. The three most beautiful Muses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
of the city were to present themselves on a sort of
stage adorned with garlands and flags, each of whom
was to open the roll containing the prize poem and
to proclaim three times the name of its author: if
the author were present, he was to be invited to read
his verses and receive his flower; if he were not
present, his verses were to be read for him.
Throughout the whole city they talked of nothing
but the academy, guessed the names of the victors,
predicted the wonders of the three poems, and extolled
the decorations of the hall. This festival of
poetry, called the <i>juegos floreales</i>, had not been celebrated
for ten years. Others may judge whether
such contests and displays benefit or injure poets
and poetry. As for me, whatever may be the
dubious and fleeting literary glory which is bestowed
by the sentence of the jury and the homage of a
bishop and a governor, I believe that to receive
the gift of a golden flower from the hand of a most
beautiful woman under the eyes of five hundred fair
Andalusians, to the sound of soft music and amid
the perfume of jessamine and roses, that would be
a delight even truer and more lively than any which
comes from real and enduring glory. No? Ah! we
are sincere.</p>

<p>One of my first thoughts was to taste a little of
the genuine Malaga wine, for no other reason than
to repay myself for the many headaches and stomachaches
caused by the miserable concoctions sold in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
many Italian cities under the false recommendation
of its name. But either I did not know how to ask
or they did not wish to understand: the fact remains
that the wine they gave me at the hotel burned my
throat and made my head spin. I was not able to
walk straight even to the cathedral, or from the
cathedral to the castle of Gibralfaro, or to the other
places, nor could I form an idea of the beauties of
Malaga without seeing them double and unsteadily,
as some spiteful person might suppose.</p>

<p>On our walk my friend talked to me about the
famous Republican people of Malaga, who are every
moment doing something on their own account.
They are a very fiery people, but fickle and yet
tractable, like all people who feel much and think
little; and they act upon the impulse of passion
rather than the strength of conviction. The least
trifle calls together an immense crowd and stirs up a
tumult that turns the city topsy-turvy; but on most
occasions a resolute act of a man in authority, an
exhibition of courage, or a burst of eloquence is
sufficient to quiet the tumult and disperse the crowd.
The nature of the people is good on the whole, but
superstition and passion have perverted them. And,
above all, superstition is perhaps more firmly entrenched
in Malaga than in any other city of Andalusia,
by reason of the greater popular ignorance.
Altogether, Malaga was the least Andalusian of the
cities I had seen: even the very language has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
corrupted, and they speak worse Spanish than at
Cadiz, where, forsooth! they speak badly enough.</p>

<p>I was still at Malaga, but my imagination was far
away among the streets of Granada and in the gardens
of the Alhambra and the Generalife. Shortly
after the noon hour I took my leave from the only
city in Spain, to tell the truth, that I left without a
sigh of regret. When the train started, instead of
turning for a last look, as I had done in all of its
sister towns, I murmured the verses sung by Giovanni
Prati at Granada when the duke d'Aosta was leaving
for Spain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Non piÃ¹ Granata Ã¨ sola</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Sulle sur mute pietre;</div>
  <div class="verse">L'inno in Alhambra vola</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Sulle Moresche cetre."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(<i>No more does Granada stand alone on her silent
stones: the hymn flies to the Alhambra on Moorish
lyres.</i>)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, as I write them again, it seems to me
that the music of the band of the National Guard of
Turin inspires peace and gladness more even surely
than Moorish lyres, and that the pavement of the
porticoes of the Po, although it be ever so silent, is
better laid and smoother than the stones of Granada.</p>

<h2><a name="GRANADA" id="GRANADA"></a>GRANADA.</h2>


<p>The journey from Malaga to Granada was the
most adventurous and unfortunate that I made in
Spain.</p>

<p>In order that my compassionate readers may pity
me as much as I desire, they must know (I am
ashamed to occupy people with these little details)
that at Malaga I had eaten only the lightest sort of
an Andalusian repast, of which at the moment of
departure I retained a very vague recollection.
But I started, feeling sure that I could alight at
some railway-station where there would be one of
those rooms or public choking-places where one
enters at a gallop, eats until one is out of breath,
pays as one scampers out to rush into a crowded
carriage, suffocated and robbed, to curse the schedule,
travel, and the minister of public works who
deceives the country. I departed, and for the first
hours it was delightful. The country was all gently
sloping hills and green fields, dotted with villages
crowned with palms and cypresses, and in the carriage,
between two old men who rode with their eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
shut, there was a little Andalusian who kept looking
around with a roguish smile which seemed to say,
"Go on; your lovelorn glances do not offend me."
But the train crept along as slowly as a worn-out
diligence, and we stopped only a few moments at
the stations. By sunset my stomach began to cry
for help, and, to render the pangs of hunger even
more severe, I was obliged to make a good part of
the journey on foot. The train stopped at an unsafe
bridge, and all the passengers got out and filed
around, two by two, to meet the train on the other
side of the river. We were surrounded by the
rocks of the Sierra Nevada, in a wild, desert place,
which made it seem as if we were a company of
hostages led by a band of brigands. When we had
clambered into the carriage the train crawled along
no faster than before, and my stomach began to
complain more desperately than at first. After a
long time we arrived at a station all crowded with
trains, where a large part of the travellers hurried
out before I could reach the step.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked a railroad official,
who had seen me alight.</p>

<p>"To dine," I replied.</p>

<p>"But aren't you going to Granada?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you won't have time; the train starts
immediately."</p>

<p>"But the others have gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>"You will see them come back on the run in a
minute."</p>

<p>The freight-trains in front prevented me from
seeing the station; I thought it was a great way
off, and so stayed where I was. Two minutes
passed, five, eight; the tourists did not return and
the train did not start. I jumped out, ran to the
station, saw a cafÃ©, and entered a large room.
Great heavens! Fifty starving people were standing
around a refreshment-table with their noses in
their plates, elbows in the air, and their eyes on the
clock, devouring and shouting; another fifty were
crowding around a counter seizing and pocketing
bread, fruit, and candies, while the proprietor and
the waiters, panting like horses and streaming with
sweat, ran about, tucked up their sleeves, howled,
tumbled over the seats and upset the customers,
and scattered here and there streams of soup and
drops of sauce; and one poor woman, who must
have been the mistress of the cafÃ©, imprisoned in a
little niche behind the besieged counter, ran her
hands through her hair in desperation. At this
sight my arms hung down helplessly. But suddenly
I roused myself and made an onslaught. Driven
back by a feminine elbow in my chest, I rushed in
again; repulsed by a jab in the stomach, I gathered
all my strength to make a third attack. At this
point the bell rang. There was a burst of imprecations
and then a falling of seats, a scattering of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
plates, a hurry-scurry, and a perfect pandemonium.
One man, choking in the fury of his last mouthfuls,
became livid and his eyes seemed bursting from
his head as though he were being hanged; another
in stretching out his hand to seize an orange, struck
by some one rushing past, plunged it into a bowl
of cream; another was running through the room in
search of his valise with a great smear of sauce on
his cheeks; another, who had tried to drink his
wine at one gulp, had strangled and coughed as if
he would tear open his stomach; the officials at the
door cried, "Hurry!" and the travellers called back
from the room, "Ahogate!" (choked), and the
waiters ran after those who had not paid, and those
who wanted to pay could not find the waiters; and
the ladies swooned, and the children cried, and
everything was upside down.</p>

<p>By good fortune I was able to get into my carriage
before the train started.</p>

<p>But there a new punishment awaited me. The
two old men and the little Andalusian, who must
have been the daughter of the one and niece of the
other, had been successful in securing a little booty
in the midst of that accursed crowd at the counter,
and they were eating right and left. I began to
watch them with sorrowful eyes like a dog beside
his master's table, counting the mouthfuls and the
number of times they chewed. The little Andalusian
noticed it, and, pointing to something which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
looked like a croquet, made a gracious bow as if to
ask if I would take it.</p>

<p>"Oh no, thank you," I replied with the smile of
a dying man; "I have eaten."</p>

<p>My angel, I continued to myself, if you only knew
that at this moment I would prefer those two croquets
to the bitter apples&mdash;as Sir Niccolo Machiavelli
would generously say&mdash;even those bitter apples
from the famous garden of the Hesperides!</p>

<p>"Try a drop of liquor at least," said the old
uncle.</p>

<p>I do not know what childish pique against myself
or against those good people took possession of me,
but it was a feeling which other men experience on
similar occasions; however, I replied this time too,
"No, thank you; it would be bad for me."</p>

<p>The good old man looked me over from head to
foot as if to say that I did not appear like a man to
be the worse for a drop of liquor, and the Andalusian
smiled, and I blushed for shame.</p>

<p>Night settled down, and the train went on at the
pace of Sancho Panza's steed for I knew not how
many hours. That night I felt for the first time in
my life the pangs of hunger, which I thought I had
felt already on the famous day of the twenty-fourth
of June, 1866. To relieve these torments I obstinately
thought of all the dishes which filled me with
repugnance&mdash;raw tomatoes, snails in soup, roasted
crabs, and snails in salad. Alas! a voice of derision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
told me, deep down in my vitals, that if I had any
of them I should eat them and lick my fingers.
Then I began to make imaginary messes of different
dishes, as cream and fish, with a dash of wine, with
a coat of pepper, and a layer of juniper preserves,
to see if I could thus hold my stomach in check.
Oh misery! my cowardly stomach did not repel
even those. Then I made a final effort and imagined
that I was at table in a Parisian hotel at the time of
the siege, and that I gently lifted a mouse by the
tail out of some pungent sauce, and the mouse, unexpectedly
regaining life, bit my thumb and transfixed
me with two wicked little eyes, and I, with
raised fork, hesitated whether to let it go or to spit
it without pity. But, thank Heaven! before I had
settled this horrible question, to perform such an act
as has never been recorded in the history of any
siege, the train stopped and a ray of hope revived
my drooping spirits.</p>

<p>We had reached some nameless village, and while
I was putting my head out of the window a voice
cried, "All out for Granada!" I rushed headlong
from the carriage and found myself face to face with
a huge bearded fellow, who took my valise, telling
me that he was going to put it in the diligence, for
from that village to I know not how many miles
from <i>imperial Granada</i> there is no railway.</p>

<p>"One moment!" I cried to the unknown man in
a supplicating voice: "how long before you start?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>"Two minutes," he replied.</p>

<p>"Is there an inn here?"</p>

<p>"There it is." I flew to the inn, bolted a hard-boiled
egg, and rushed back to the diligence, crying,
"How much time now?"</p>

<p>"Two minutes more," answered the same voice.</p>

<p>I flew back to the hotel, seized another egg, and
ran again to the diligence with the question, "Are
you off?"</p>

<p>"In a minute."</p>

<p>Back again to the inn, and a third egg, and then
to the diligence: "Are we going?"</p>

<p>"In half a minute."</p>

<p>This time I heaved a mighty sigh, ran to the inn,
swallowed a fourth egg and a glass of wine, and
rushed toward the diligence. But before I had
taken ten steps my breath gave out, and I stopped
with the egg halfway down my throat. At this
point the whip cracked.&mdash;"Wait!" I cried in a
hoarse voice, waving my hands like a drowning
man.</p>

<p>"<i>Que hay?</i>" (What's the matter?) demanded the
driver.</p>

<p>I could not reply.</p>

<p>"He has an egg stuck in his throat," some
stranger answered for me.</p>

<p>All the travellers burst into a laugh, the egg went
down; I laughed too, overtook the diligence, which
had already started, and, regaining my breath, gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
my companions an account of my troubles, and they
were much interested, and pitied me even more than
I had dared to hope after that cruel laugh at my
suffocation.</p>

<p>But my troubles were not ended. One of those
irresistible attacks of sleepiness which used to come
upon me treacherously in the long night-marches
among the soldiers seized me all at once, and tormented
me as far as the railway-station without my
being able to get a moment of sleep. I believe that
a cannon-ball suspended by a cord from the roof of
the diligence would have given less annoyance to
my unfortunate companions than my poor nodding
head gave as it bobbed on all sides as if it was attached
to my neck by a single tendon. On one side
of me sat a nun, on the other a boy, and opposite a
peasant-woman, and throughout the entire journey I
did nothing but strike my head against these three
victims with the monotonous motion of a bell-clapper.
The nun, poor creature! endured the strokes
in silence, perhaps in expiation for her sins of
thought; but the boy and peasant-woman muttered
from time to time, "He is a barbarian!"&mdash;"This
must stop!"&mdash;"His head is like lead!" Finally, a
witticism from one of the passengers released all four
of us from this suffering. The peasant-woman was
lamenting a little louder than usual, and a voice from
the end of the diligence exclaimed, "Be consoled; if
your head is not yet broken, you may be sure it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
not be, for it must certainly be proof against the
hammer." They all laughed; I awakened, excused
myself, and the three victims were so happy to
find themselves released from that cruel thumping
that, instead of taking revenge with bitter words,
they said, "Poor fellow! you have slept badly.
How you must have hurt your head!"</p>

<p>We finally arrived at the railway, and behold
what a perverse fate! Although I was alone in the
railway-carriage, where I might have slept like a
nabob, I could not close my eyes. A pang went
through my heart at the thought of having made
the journey by night when I could not see anything
nor enjoy the distant view of Granada. And I
remembered the lovely verses of Martinez de la
Rosa:</p>

<p>"O my dear fatherland! At last I see thee
again! I see thy fair soil, thy joyful teeming fields,
thy glorious sun, thy serene sky!</p>

<p>"Yes! I see the fabled Granada stretching along
the plain from hill to hill, her towers rising among
her gardens of eternal green, the crystal streams
kissing her walls, the noble mountains enclosing her
valleys, and the Sierra Nevada crowning the distant
horizon.</p>

<p>"Oh, thy memory haunted me wherever I went,
Granada! It destroyed my pleasures, my peace,
and my glory, and oppressed my heart and soul!
By the icy banks of the Seine and the Thames<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
I remembered with a sigh the happy waters of
the Darro and the Genil, and many times, as I carolled
a gay ballad, my bitter grief overcame me,
and weeping, not to be repressed, choked my
voice.</p>

<p>"In vain the delightful Arno displayed her
flower-strewn banks, sweet seats of love and peace!
'The plain watered by the gentle Genil,' said I, 'is
more flowery, the life of the lovely Granada is more
dear.' And I murmured these words as one disconsolate,
and, remembering the house of my fathers,
I raised my sad eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>"What is thy magic, what thy unspeakable spell,
O fatherland! O sweet name! that thou art so dear?
The swarthy African, far from his native desert,
looks with sad disdain on fields of green; the rude
Laplander, stolen from his mother-earth, sighs for
perpetual night and snow; and I&mdash;I, to whom a
kindly fate granted birth and nurture in thy bosom
blest by so many gifts of God&mdash;though far from thee,
could I forget thee, Granada?"</p>

<p>When I reached Granada it was quite dark, and
I could not see so much as the outlines of a house.
A diligence drawn by two horses,</p>

<p>landed me at a hotel, where I was kept waiting an
hour while my bed was being made, and finally, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
before three o'clock in the morning, I was at last
able to lay my head on the pillow. But my troubles
were not over: just as I was falling into a doze I
heard an indistinct murmur in the next room, and
then a masculine voice which said distinctly, "Oh,
what a little foot!" You who have bowels of compassion,
pity me. The pillow was torn a little; I
pulled out two tufts of wool, stuffed them in my
ears; and, rehearsing in thought the misfortunes
of my journey, I slept the sleep of the just.</p>

<p>In the morning I went out betimes and walked
about through the streets of Granada until it was a
decent hour to go and drag from his home a young
gentleman of Granada whom I had met at Madrid
at the house of Fernandez Guerra, Gongora by
name, the son of a distinguished archeologist and a
descendant of the famous Cordovan poet Luigi Gongora,
of whom I spoke in passing. That part of
the city which I saw in those few hours did not fulfil
my expectation. I had expected to find narrow
mysterious streets and white cottages like those of
Cordova and Seville, but I found instead spacious
squares and some handsome straight streets, and
others tortuous and narrow enough, it is true, but
flanked by high houses, for the most part painted in
false bas-reliefs with cupids and garlands and flourishes
and draperies, and hangings of a thousand
colors, without the Oriental appearance of the other
Andalusian cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>The lowest part of Granada is almost all laid out
with the regularity of a modern city. As I passed
along those streets I was filled with contempt, and
should certainly have carried a gloomy face to
SeÃ±or Gongora if by chance as I walked at random
I had not come out into the famous <i>Alameda</i>, which
enjoys the reputation of being the most beautiful
promenade in the world, and it repaid me a thousand
times for the detestable regularity of the
streets which lead to it.</p>

<p>Imagine a long avenue of unusual width, along
which fifty carriages might pass abreast, flanked by
other smaller avenues, along which run rows of
measureless trees, which at a noble height form an
immense green arch, so dense that not a sunbeam
can penetrate it, and at the two ends of the central
avenue two monumental fountains throwing up the
water in two great streams which fall again in the
finest vaporous spray, and between the many
avenues crystal streams, and in the middle a garden
all roses and myrtle and jessamine and delicate
fountains; and on one side the river Genil,
which flows between banks covered with laurel-groves,
and in the distance the snowclad mountains,
upon whose sides distant palms raise their fantastic
fronds; and everywhere a brilliant green, dense
and luxuriant, through which one sees here and
there an enchanting strip of azure sky.</p>

<p>As I turned off of the Alameda I met a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
number of peasants going out of the city, two by
two and in groups, with their wives and children,
singing and jesting. Their dress did not seem to
me different from that of the peasants in the neighborhood
of Cordova and Seville. They wore velvet
hats, some with very broad brims, others with high
brims curved back; a little jacket made with bands
of many-colored cloth; a scarf of red or blue;
closely-fitting trousers buttoned along the hip;
and a pair of leathern gaiters open at the side,
so as to show the leg. The women were dressed
like those in the other provinces, and even in their
faces there was no noticeable difference.</p>

<p>I reached my friend's house and found him buried
in his archÃ¦ological studies, sitting in front of a heap
of old medals and historic stones. He received me
with delight, with a charming Andalusian courtesy,
and, after exchanging the first greetings, we both
pronounced with one voice that magic word that in
every part of the world stirs a tumult of great recollections
in every heart and arouses a sense of secret
longing; that gives a final spur toward Spain to one
who has the desire to travel thither and has not yet
finally resolved to start; that name at which hearts
of poets and painters beat faster and the eyes of
women flash&mdash;"The Alhambra!"</p>

<p>We rushed out of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Alhambra is situated upon a high hill which
overlooks the city, and from a distance presents the
appearance of a fortress, like almost all Oriental
palaces. But when, with Gongora, I climbed the
street of <i>Los Gomeles</i> on our way toward the famous
edifice, I had not yet seen the least trace of a distant
wall, and I did not know in what part of the city we
should find it. The street of <i>Los Gomeles</i> slopes upward
and describes a slight curve, so that for a good
way one sees only houses ahead, and supposes the
Alhambra to be far away. Gongora did not speak,
but I read in his face that in his heart he was greatly
enjoying the thought of the surprise and delight that
I should experience. He looked at the ground with
a smile, answering all my questions with a sign
which seemed to say, "Wait a minute!" and now
and then raised his eyes almost furtively to measure
the remaining distance. And I so enjoyed his pleasure
that I could have thrown my arms around his
neck in gratitude.</p>

<p>We arrived before a great gate that closed the
street. "Here we are!" said Gongora. I entered.</p>

<p>I found myself in a great grove of enormously
high trees, leaning one toward another, on this side
and on that, along a great avenue which climbs the
hill and is lost in the shade: so close are the trees
that a man could scarcely pass among them, and
wherever one looks one sees only their trunks,
which close the way like a continuous wall. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
branches meet above the avenues; not a sunbeam
penetrates the wood; the shade is very dense;
on every side glide murmuring streams, and the
birds sing, and one feels a vernal freshness in the
air.</p>

<p>"We are now in the Alhambra," said Gongora:
"turn around, and you will see the towers and the
embattled barrier-wall."</p>

<p>"But where is the palace?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"That is a mystery," he answered; "let us go
forward at random."</p>

<p>We climbed an avenue running along beside the
great central avenue that winds up toward the summit.
The trees form overhead a green pavilion
through which not a particle of sky is visible, and
the grass, the shrubbery, and the flowers make on
either side a lovely border, bright and fragrant,
sloping slightly toward each other, as if they are
trying to unite, mutually attracted by the beauty of
their colors and the fragrance of their perfume.</p>

<p>"Let us rest a moment," I said: "I want to take
a great breath of this air; it seems to contain some
secret germs that if infused into the blood must
prolong one's life; it is air redolent of youth and
health."</p>

<p>"Behold the door!" exclaimed Gongora.</p>

<p>I turned as if I had been struck in the back, and
saw a few steps ahead a great square tower, of a
deep-red color, crowned with battlements, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
arched door, above which one sees a key and a
hand cut in the stone.</p>

<p>I questioned my guide, and he told me that this
was the principal entrance of the Alhambra, and that
it was called the Gate of Justice, because the Moorish
kings used to pronounce sentence beneath that arch.
The key signifies that this door is the key to the
fortress, and the hand symbolizes the five cardinal
virtues of Islam&mdash;Prayer, Fasting, Beneficence, Holy
War, and the Pilgrimage to Mecca. The Arabian
inscription attests that the edifice was erected four
centuries ago by the Sultan Abul Hagag Yusuf, and
another inscription, which one sees everywhere on
the columns, says, "There is no God but Allah, and
Mohammed is his Prophet! and there is no power,
no strength, apart from Allah!"</p>

<p>We passed under the arch and continued the
ascent along an enclosed street until we found ourselves
at the top of the hill, in the middle of an
esplanade surrounded by a parapet and dotted with
shrubs and flowers. I turned at once toward the
valley to enjoy the view, but Gongora seized me
by the arm and made me look in the opposite direction.
I was standing in front of the great palace of
the Renaissance, partly in ruins and flanked by some
wretched little houses.</p>

<p>"Is this a joke?" I demanded. "Have you
brought me here to see a Moorish castle, for me to
find the way closed by a modern palace? Whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
abominable idea was it to run up this building in the
gardens of the caliphs?"</p>

<p>"Charles V.'s."</p>

<p>"He was a vandal. I have not yet forgiven him
for the Gothic church he planted in the middle of
the mosque of Cordova, and now these barracks
fill me with utter loathing of his crown and his
glory. But, in the name of Heaven, where is the
Alhambra?"</p>

<p>"There it is."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Among those huts."</p>

<p>"Oh, fudge!"</p>

<p>"I pledge you my word of honor."</p>

<p>I folded my arms and looked at him, and he
laughed."</p>

<p>"Well, then," I exclaimed, "this great name of
the Alhambra is only another of those usual false
exaggerations of the poets. I, Europe, and the world
have been shamefully deceived. Was it worth while
to dream of the Alhambra for three hundred and
sixty-five nights in succession, and then to come to
see a group of ruins with some broken columns and
smoky inscriptions?"</p>

<p>"How I enjoy this!" answered Gongora with a
peal of laughter. "Cheer up now; come and be
persuaded that the world has not been deceived:
let us enter this rubbish-pile."</p>

<p>We entered by a little door, crossed a corridor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
and found ourselves in a court. With a sudden cry
I seized Gongora's hand, and he asked with a tone
of triumph,</p>

<p>"Are you persuaded?"</p>

<p>I did not answer, I did not see him: I was already
far away; the Alhambra had already begun to exercise
upon me that mysterious and powerful fascination
which no one can avoid nor any one express.</p>

<p>We were in the <i>Patio de los Arrayanes</i>, the Court
of the Myrtles, which is the largest in the edifice,
and presents at once the appearance of a room, a
courtyard, and a garden. A great rectangular basin
full of water, surrounded by a myrtle hedge, extends
from one side of the <i>patio</i> to the other, and like a
mirror reflects the arches, arabesques, and the mural
inscriptions.</p>

<p>To the right of the entrance there extend two
orders of Moorish arches, one above the other, supported
by slender columns, and on the opposite side
of the court rises a tower with a door through which
one sees the inner rooms in semi-darkness and the
mullioned windows, and through the windows the
blue sky and the summits of the distant mountains.
The walls are ornamented to a certain height from
the pavement with brilliant mosaics, and above the
mosaics with arabesques of very intricate design
that seem to tremble and change at every step, and
here and there among the arabesques and along the
arches they stretch and creep and intertwine, like
garlands, Moorish inscriptions containing greetings,
proverbs, and legends.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><i><a id="Court_of_Myrtles"></a>Court of Myrtles, Alhambra</i></div>
<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b194cs.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>Beside the door of entrance is written in Cufic characters:
Eternal Happiness!&mdash;Blessing!&mdash;Prosperity!&mdash;Felicity!&mdash;Praised
be God for the blessing
of Islam!</p>

<p>In another place it is written: I seek my refuge
in the Lord of the Morning.</p>

<p>In another place: O God! to thee belong eternal
thanksgiving and undying praise.</p>

<p>Elsewhere there are verses from the Koran and
entire poems in praise of the caliphs.</p>

<p>We stood some minutes in silent admiration; not
the buzz of a fly was heard; now and then Gongora
started toward the tower, but I clutched him by the
arm and felt that he was trembling with impatience.</p>

<p>"But we must make haste," said he, finally,
"or else we shall not get back to Granada before
evening."</p>

<p>"What do I know of Granada?" I answered;
"what do I know of morning or evening or of
myself? I am in the Orient!"</p>

<p>"But this is only the antechamber of the Alhambra,
my dear Arabian," said Gongora, urging me
forward. "Come, come with me where it will
really seem like being in the Orient."</p>

<p>And he led me, reluctant though I was, to the
very threshold of the tower-door. There I turned
to look once more at the Court of Myrtles and gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
a cry of surprise. Between two slender columns
of the arched gallery which faces the tower, on the
opposite side of the courtyard, stood a girl, a beautiful
dark Andalusian face, with a white mantle
wound around her head and falling over her shoulder:
she stood leaning upon the railing in a languid
attitude, with her eyes fixed upon us. I cannot
tell the fantastic effect produced by that figure
at that moment&mdash;the grace imparted by the arch
which curved above the girl's head and the two
columns which formed a frame around her, and the
beautiful harmony which she gave to the whole
court, as if she were an ornament necessary to its
architecture conceived in the mind of the architect
at the moment he imagined the whole design. She
seemed like a sultana awaiting her lord, thinking
of another sky and another love. She continued
looking at us, and my heart began to beat faster.
I questioned my friend with my eyes, as if to be
assured that I was not deceived. Suddenly the
sultana laughed, dropped her white mantle, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"She is a servant," said Gongora.</p>

<p>Still I remained in the mist.</p>

<p>She was, in fact, a servant of the custodian of
the Alhambra who was in the habit of practising
that joke upon strangers.</p>

<p>We entered the tower called the Tower of Comares,
or, vulgarly, the Tower of the Ambassadors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
The interior forms two halls, the first of which is
called the Hall of the Barca, and takes its name
either from the fact that it is shaped like a boat or
because it was called by the Moors the Hall of
<i>Baraka</i>, or Blessing, a word which might have been
contracted by the people into <i>barca</i> (a boat.) This
hall hardly seems the work of human hands: it is
all a vast network of tracery in the form of garlands,
rosettes, boughs of trees, and leaves, covering
the vaulted ceiling, the arches, and the walls in
every part and in every way&mdash;closely twining,
checkered, climbing higher and higher, and yet
marvellously distinct and combined in such a manner
that the parts are presented to the eye altogether
at a single glance, affording a spectacle of
dazzling magnificence and enchanting grace. I
approached one of the walls, fixed my eyes upon
the extreme point of an arabesque, and tried to
follow its windings and turnings: it was impossible;
my eye was lost, my mind confused, and all the
arabesques from pavement to ceiling seemed to be
moving and blending, as if to conceal the thread of
their inextricable network. You may make an
effort not to look around, to centre your whole
attention upon a single spot of the wall, to scan
it closely and follow the thread with your finger:
it is futile; in a moment the tracery is a tangled
skein, a veil steals between you and the wall, and
your arm falls. The wall seems woven like a web,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
wrought like brocade, netted like lace, and veined
like a leaf; one cannot look at it closely nor fix its
design in one's mind: it would be like trying to
count the ants in an anthill: one must be content
to look at the walls with a wandering glance, then
to rest and look again later, and then to think of
something else and talk. After I had looked around
a little with the air of a man overcome with vertigo
rather than admiration, I turned toward Gongora,
so that he might read in my face what I would have
spoken.</p>

<p>"Let us enter the other pile of ruins," he answered
with a smile as he drew me into the great
Hall of the Ambassadors, which fills all the interior
of the tower, for, really, the Hall of the <i>Barca</i>
belongs to a little building which does not form a
part of the tower, although it is joined to it. The
tower is square in form, spacious, and lighted with
nine great arched windows in the form of doors,
which present almost the appearance of so many
alcoves, so great is the thickness of the wall; each
one is divided down the middle toward the outside
by a little marble column that supports two beautiful
arches surmounted in their turn by two little
arched windows. The walls are covered with
mosaics and arabesques indescribably delicate and
multiform, and with innumerable inscriptions extending
like wide embroidered ribbons over the arches
of the windows, up the massive cornices, along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
friezes, and around the niches where once stood
vases full of flowers and perfumed water. The
ceiling, which rises to a great height, is inlaid with
cedar-wood, white, gold, and azure, joined together
in circles, stars, and crowns, and forming many
little arches, cells, and vaulted windows, through
which falls a wavering light, and from the cornice
which joins the ceiling to the walls hang tablets
of stucco-work cut in facets chiselled and moulded
like stalactites and bunches of flowers. The throne
stood at the central window on the side opposite the
door of entrance. From the windows on that side
one enjoys a stupendous view of the valley of the
Darro, deep and silent, as if it too felt the fascination
of the Alhambra's grandeur; from the windows
on the other two sides one sees the boundary-wall
and the towers of the fortress; and through the
entrance the light arches of the Court of the Myrtles
in the distance and the water of the basin, which
reflects the blue of the sky.</p>

<p>"Well!" Gongora demanded; "was it worth
dreaming of the Alhambra for three hundred and
sixty-five nights?"</p>

<p>"There is a strange thought passing through
my brain at this moment," I replied. "That court
as it looks from here, that hall, those windows, those
colors, everything that surrounds me, seems familiar;
it seems to correspond with a picture which I have
carried in my head I know not how long and I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
not in what manner, confused with a thousand other
things, perhaps born of a dream&mdash;how should I
know? When I was sixteen years old I was a
lover, and the young girl and I alone in a garden
in the shade of a summer-house, as we gazed in
each other's eyes, uttered unconsciously a cry of
joy that stirred our blood as if it had come from
the mouth of a third person who had discovered our
secret. Well, since that time I have often longed
to be a king and to have a palace; but in giving
form to that desire my imagination did not rest
merely in the grand gilded palaces of our country;
it flew to distant lands, and there on the summit of
a lofty mountain reared a castle of its own in which
everything was small and graceful and illumined by
a mysterious light; and there were long suites of
rooms adorned with a thousand fanciful and delicate
ornaments, with windows through which we two
alone might look, and little columns behind which
my little one might almost hide her face playfully
as she listened to my step approaching from hall to
hall, or heard my voice mingled with the murmur
of the fountains in the garden. All unconsciously,
in building that castle in fantasy, I was building
the Alhambra; in those moments I imagined something
like these halls, these windows, and this court
that we see before us&mdash;so similar, indeed, that the
more I look around the better I remember and seem
to recognize the place just as I have seen it a thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>sand
times. All lovers dream a little of the Alhambra,
and if they were able to reproduce all their
dreams in line and color, they would make pictures
that would amaze us by their likeness to all one sees
here. This architecture does not express power,
glory, and grandeur; it expresses love and passion&mdash;love
with its mysteries, its caprices, its fervor,
its bursts of God-given gratitude; passion with its
melancholy and its silences. There is, then, a close
connection, a harmony, between the beauty of this
Alhambra and the souls of those who have loved at
sixteen, when longings are but dreams and visions.
And hence arises the indescribable fascination exercised
by this beauty, and hence the Alhambra, although
deserted and ruined as it is, is still the most
enchanting castle in the world, and to the end of
time visitors will leave it with a tear. For in parting
with the Alhambra we bid a last adieu to the
most beautiful dreams of youth revived among these
walls for the last time. We bid adieu to faces unspeakably
dear that have broken the oblivion of
many years to stand beside us a last time by the
little columns of these windows. We bid adieu to
all the fancies of youth. We bid adieu to that love
which will never live again."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><i>Fountain in the <a id="Court_of_Lions"></a>Court of Lions, Alhambra</i></div>
<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b200cs.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p>"It is true," answered my friend, "but what will
you say when you have seen the Court of the Lions?
Come, let us hurry."</p>

<p>We left the tower with hasty steps, crossed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Court of Myrtles, and came to a little door opposite
the door of entrance.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Gongora.</p>

<p>I stopped.</p>

<p>"Do me a favor?"</p>

<p>"A hundred."</p>

<p>"Only one: shut your eyes and don't open them
until I tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, they are shut."</p>

<p>"See that you keep them so; I sha'n't like it if
you open them."</p>

<p>"Never fear."</p>

<p>Gongora took me by the hand and led me forward:
I trembled like a leaf.</p>

<p>We took about fifteen steps and stopped.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Gongora in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>I looked, and I swear by the head of my reader I
felt two tears trickling down my cheeks.</p>

<p>We were in the Court of the Lions.</p>

<p>If at that moment I had been obliged to go out as
I had come in, I could not have told what I had seen.
A forest of columns, a vision of arches and tracery,
an indefinable elegance, an unimaginable delicacy,
prodigious wealth; an irrepressible sense of airiness,
transparency, and wavy motion like a great
pavilion of lace; an appearance as of an edifice
which must dissolve at a breath; a variety of lights
and mysterious shadows; a confusion, a capricious
disorder, of little things; the grandeur of a castle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the gayety of a summer-house; an harmonious grace,
an extravagance, a delight; the fancy of an enamored
girl, the dream of an angel; a madness, a
nameless something,&mdash;such is the first effect of the
Court of the Lions.</p>

<p>The court is not larger than a great ball-room; it
is rectangular in form, with walls no higher than a
two-storied Andalusian cottage. A light portico
runs all around, supported by very slender white
marble columns grouped in symmetrical disorder, two
by two and three by three, almost without pedestals, so
that they are like the trunks of trees standing on the
ground: they have varied capitals, high and graceful,
in the form of little pilasters, above which bend
little arches of very graceful form, which do not
seem to rest upon the columns, but rather to be
suspended over them like curtains upholding the
columns themselves and resembling ribbons and
twining garlands. From the middle of the two
shortest sides advance two groups of columns forming
two little square temples of nine arches in the
form of stalactites, fringes, pendants, and tassels that
seem as though they ought to swing and become
tangled with the slightest breeze. Large Arabian
inscriptions run along the four walls, over the arches,
around the capitals, and along the walls of the little
temple. In the middle of the court rises a great
marble basin supported by twelve lions and surrounded
by a paved channel, from which flow four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
other smaller channels that make a cross between
the four sides of the court, cross the portico, enter
the adjoining rooms, and join the other water-courses
which surround the entire edifice. Behind the two
two little temples and in the middle of the other two
sides there appear halls and suites of rooms with
great open doors, through which one can see the
dark background broken by the white columns,
gleaming as if they stood at the mouth of a grotto.
At every step the forest of columns seems to move
and rearrange itself in a new way; behind a
column that is apparently single spring up two,
three, a row of columns; some fade away, others
unite, and still others separate: on looking back
from the end of one of the halls everything appears
different; the arches on the opposite side seem very
far away; the columns appear out of place; the little
temples have changed their form; one sees new
arches rising beyond the walls, and new columns
gleaming here in the sunlight, there in the shadow,
yonder scarcely visible by the dim light which sifts
through the tracery of the stucco, and the farthest
lost in the darkness. There is a constant variety of
scene, distance, deceptive effects, mysteries, and
playful tricks of the eye, produced by the architecture,
the sun, and one's heightened imagination.</p>

<p>"What must this <i>patio</i> have been," said Gongora,
"when the inner walls of the portico were resplendent
with mosaics, the capitals of the columns flashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
with gold, the ceilings and vaults were painted in
a thousand colors, the doors hung with silken curtains,
the niches full of flowers, and under the little
temples and through the halls ran streams of perfumed
water, and from the nostrils of the lions
spurted twelve jets which fell into the basin, and
the air was heavy with the most delicious perfumes
of Arabia!"</p>

<p>We remained in the court over an hour, and the
time passed like a flash; and I too did what all have
done in that place&mdash;Spaniards and foreigners alike,
men and women, poets and those who are not poets.
I ran my hand along the walls, touched all the little
columns, clasped them one by one with my two hands
like the waist of a child, hid among them, counted
them, looked at them from a hundred directions,
crossed the court in a hundred ways; tried if it were
true that by speaking a word in a deep voice in the
mouth of one of the lions you could hear it distinctly
from the mouths of all the others; searched
along the marbles for the blood-spots of the romantic
legends, and wearied my eyes and brain in following
the arabesques. There were a number of ladies
present. In the Court of the Lions ladies show every
sort of childish delight: they look out between two
twin columns, hide in the dark corners, sit on the
floor, and stand for hours motionless, resting their
heads upon their hands, dreaming. These ladies did
likewise. There was one dressed in white who, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
she passed behind the distant columns, when she
thought no one saw her assumed a certain majestic
air, like a melancholy sultana, and then laughed
with one of her friends: it was enchanting.</p>

<p>"Let us go," said my friend.</p>

<p>"Let us go," I replied, and could not move a step.
I was experiencing not only a delightful sense of
surprise, but I was trembling with pleasure, and was
filled with a longing to touch, to probe, and in some
way to see behind those walls and those columns, as
if they were made of some secret material and ought
to disclose in their inmost part the first cause of the
fascination which the place exerts. In all my life I
have never thought or said, or shall ever say, so
many fond words, so many foolish expressions, so
many pretty, happy, senseless things, as I thought
and said at that hour.</p>

<p>"But one must come here at sunrise," said Gongora,
"one must come at sunset, or at night when
the moon is full, to see the miracles of color, light,
and shade. It is enough to make one lose one's
head."</p>

<p>We went to see the halls. On the eastern side is
the Hall of Justice, which is reached by passing
under three great arches, each of which corresponds
with a door opening into the court. It is a long, narrow
hall, with intricate arabesques and precious mosaics,
and its vaulted ceiling all points and hollows
and clusters of stucco that hang down from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
arches and run along the walls, clustered together
here and there, drooping, growing one out of the
other, crowding and overtopping each other, so that
they seem to dispute the space like the bubbles in boiling
water, and still presenting in many parts traces of
old colors that must have given the ceiling the appearance
of a pavilion covered with flowers and hanging
fruit. The hall has three little alcoves, in each of
which one may see a Moorish painting, to which
time and the extreme rarity of works remaining
from the brush of Moorish artists have given a very
high value. The paintings are on leather, and the
leather is fastened to the wall. In the central alcove
there are painted on a golden ground ten men, supposed
to be ten kings of Granada, clothed in white,
with cowls on their heads and scimitars in their
hands, sitting on embroidered cushions. The paintings
in the other two alcoves represent castles,
ladies and cavaliers, hunting scenes, and love episodes
whose significance it is difficult to understand.
But the faces of the ten kings are marvellously true
to the picture one has formed of their race: there is
the dark olive complexion, the sensuous lips, the
black eyes, with an intense mysterious glance that
seems always to be shining in the dark corners of
the halls of the Alhambra.</p>

<p>On the north side of the court there is another
hall, called the hall <i>De las dos Hermanas</i> (of the two
sisters), so called from two great marble slabs which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
form the pavement. It is the most beautiful hall in
the Alhambra&mdash;a little square arched room, with one
of those ceilings in the form of a cupola which the
Spaniards call half oranges, supported by slender
columns and arches arranged in a circle, all adorned,
like a grotto full of stalactites, with an infinite number
of points and hollows, colored and gilded, and
so light to the view that it seems as if they are
suspended in the air, and would tremble at a touch
like a curtain or separate like a cloud or disappear
like a cluster of soap-bubbles. The walls, like those
of all the other halls, are bedecked with stucco and
carved with arabesques incredibly intricate and delicate,
forming one of the most marvellous works of
human patience and imagination. The more one
looks, the more numberless become the lines which
blend and cross, and from one figure springs another,
and from that a third, and all three produce a fourth
that has escaped the eye, and this divides suddenly
into ten other figures that have passed unnoticed,
and then they mingle again and are again transformed;
and one never ceases to discover new combinations,
for when the first reappear they are
already forgotten, and produce the same effect as at
the beginning. One would lose sight and reason in
trying to comprehend that labyrinth: it would require
an hour to study the outlines of a window, the
ornaments of a pilaster, and the arabesques of a
frieze; an hour would not be sufficient to fix upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
the mind the design of one of the stupendous cedar
doors. On either side of the hall there are two
little alcoves, and in the centre a little basin with a
pipe for a fountain that empties into the channel that
crosses the portico and flows to the Fountain of the
Lions.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the entrance there is another
door, through which one passes into another long,
narrow room called the Hall of the Oranges. And
from this hall, through a third door, one enters a
little chamber called the Cabinet of Lindaraja, very
richly ornamented, at the end of which there is a
graceful window with two arches overlooking a
garden.</p>

<p>To enjoy all the beauty of this magical architecture
one must leave the Hall of the Two Sisters,
cross the Court of the Lions, and enter a room called
the Hall of the Abencerrages, which lies on the
southern side, opposite the Hall of the Two Sisters, to
which it is very similar in form and ornamentation.
From the end of this hall one looks across the
Court of the Lions through the Hall of the Two
Sisters into the Hall of the Oranges and even into
the Cabinet of Lindaraja and the garden beyond,
where a mass of verdure appears under the arches
of that jewel of a window. The two sides of this
window, so diminutive and full of light when seen in
the distance from the end of that suite of darkened
rooms, look like two great open eyes, that look at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
you and make you imagine that beyond them must
lie the unfathomable mysteries of paradise.</p>

<p>After seeing the Hall of the Abencerrages we
went to see the baths, which are situated between
the Hall of the Two Sisters and the Court of the
Myrtles. We descended a flight of stairs, passed a
long narrow corridor, and came out into a splendid
hall called the hall <i>De las Divans</i>, where the favorites
of the king came to rest on their Persian rugs
to the sound of the lyre after they had bathed in
the adjoining rooms. This hall was reconstructed
on the plans of the ancient ruins, and adorned with
arabesques, gilded and painted, by Spanish artists
after the ancient patterns; consequently one may
consider it a room of the Moorish period remaining
intact in every part. In the middle is a fountain,
and in the opposite walls are two alcoves where the
women reposed on divans, and overhead the galleries
where the musicians played. The walls are
laced, dotted, checkered, and mottled with a thousand
brilliant hues, presenting the appearance of a
tapestry of Chinese stuff shot with golden threads,
with an endless interweaving of figures that must
have maddened the most patient mosaic-worker on
earth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a painter was at work in the hall.
He was a German who had worked for three months
in copying the walls. Gongora knew him, and
asked, "It is wearisome work, is it not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>And he answered with a smile, "I don't find it
so," and bent again over his picture.</p>

<p>I looked at him as if he had been a creature from
another world.</p>

<p>We entered the little bathing-chambers, vaulted
and lighted from above by some star-and flower-shaped
apertures in the wall. The bathing-tubs
are very large, single blocks of marble enclosed between
two walls. The corridors which lead from
one room to the other are low and narrow, so that
a man can scarcely pass through them; they are
delightfully cool. As I stood looking into one of
these little rooms I was suddenly impressed with
a sad thought.</p>

<p>"What makes you sad?" asked my friend.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," I replied, "of how we live,
summer and winter, in houses like barracks, in
rooms on the third floor, which are either dark or
else flooded with a torrent of light, without marble,
without water, without flowers, without columns; I
was thinking that we must live so all our lives and
die between those walls without once experiencing
the delights of these charmed palaces; I was thinking
that even in this wretched earthly life one may
enjoy vastly, and that I shall not share this enjoyment
at all; I was thinking that I might have been
born four centuries ago a king of Granada, and that
I was born instead a poor man."</p>

<p>My friend laughed, and, taking my arm between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
his thumb and finger, as if to give me a pinch, he
said, "Don't think of that. Think of how much
beauty, grace, and mystery these tubs must have
seen; of the little feet that have played in their
perfumed waters; of the long hair which has fallen
over their rims; of the great languid eyes that have
looked at the sky through the openings in the
vaulted ceiling, while beneath the arches of the
Court of the Lions sounded the hastening step of
an impatient caliph, and the hundred fountains of
the castle sighed with a quickening murmur, 'Come!
come! come!' and in a perfumed hall a trembling
slave reverently closed the windows with the rose-colored
curtains."</p>

<p>"Ah! leave my soul in peace!" I replied, shrugging
my shoulders.</p>

<p>We crossed the garden of the Cabinet of Lindaraja
and a mysterious court called the <i>Patio de la
Reja</i>, and by a long gallery that commands a view
of the country reached the top of one of the
farthest towers of the Alhambra, called the <i>Mirador
de la Reina</i> (the Queen's toilet), shaded by a little
pavilion and open all round, hanging over an abyss
like an eagle's nest. The view one enjoys from
this point&mdash;one may say it without fear of contradiction&mdash;has
not its equal on the face of the
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>Imagine an immense plain, green as a meadow,
covered with young grass, crossed in all directions
by endless rows of cypresses, pines, oaks, and
poplars, dotted with dense orange-groves that in the
distance look no larger than shrubs, and with great
orchards and gardens so crowded with fruit trees
that they look like green hillocks; and the river
Xenil winding through this immense plain, gleaming
among the groves and gardens like a great silver
ribbon; and all around wooded hills, and beyond
the hills lofty rocks of fantastic form, which complete
the picture of a barrier-wall with gigantic
towers separating that earthly paradise from the
world; and there, just beneath one's eyes, the city
of Granada, partly extending to the plain and partly
on the slope of the hill, all interspersed with groups
of trees, shapeless masses of verdure which rise and
wave above the roofs of the houses like enormous
plumes, until it seems as if they were striving to expand
and unite and cover the entire city; and still
nearer the deep valley of the Darro more than
covered&mdash;yes, filled to overflowing and almost
heaped full&mdash;with its prodigious growth of vegetation,
rising like a mountain, and above it there rises
yet again a grove of gigantic poplars tossing their
topmost boughs so close under the windows of the
tower that one can almost touch them; and to the
right beyond the Darro, on a high hill towering
toward heaven, bold and rounded like a cupola, the
palace of the Generalife, encircled by its aÃ«rial
gardens and almost hidden in a grove of laurels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
poplars, and pomegranates; and in the opposite
direction a marvellous spectacle, a thing incredible,
a vision of a dream&mdash;the Sierra Nevada, after the
Alps, the highest mountain-range in Europe crowned
with snow, white even to a few miles from the gates
of Granada, white even to the hills on whose sides
spread the pomegranates and palms, and where a
vegetation almost tropical expands in all its splendid
pomp.</p>

<p>Imagine now over this vast paradise, containing
all the smiling graces of the Orient and all the severe
beauties of the North, wedding Europe to
Africa, and bringing to the nuptials all the choicest
marvels of nature, and exhaling to heaven all the
perfumes of the earth blended in one breath,&mdash;imagine
above this happy valley the sky and sun of
Andalusia, rolling on to its setting and tinting the
peaks with a divine rose-color, and painting the
mountain-sides of the Sierra with all the colors of
the rainbow, and clothing them with all the reflections
of the most limpid azure pearls, its rays breaking
in a thousand mists of gold, purple, and gray
upon the rocks encircling the plain, and, as it sinks
in a flame of fire, casting like a last good-night a
luminous crown about the gloomy towers of the Alhambra
and the flower-crowned pinnacles of the
Generalife, and tell me if this world can give anything
more solemn, more glorious, more intoxicating
than this love-feast of the earth and sky, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
which for nine centuries Granada has trembled with
delight and throbbed with pride?</p>

<p>The roof of the <i>Mirador de la Reina</i> is supported
by little Moorish columns, between which extend
flattened arches which give the pavilion an extremely
fanciful and graceful appearance. The
walls are frescoed, and one may see along the friezes
the initials of Isabella and Philip interwoven with
cupids and flowers. Close by the door there still remains
a stone of the ancient pavement, all perforated,
upon which it is said the sultanas sat to be enveloped
in the clouds of perfumed vapor which arose from
below.</p>

<p>Everything in this place tells of love and happiness.
There one breathes an air as pure as that on a
mountain-peak, there one perceives a mingled fragrance
of myrtles and roses, and no other sound
reaches the ear save the murmur of the Darro as it
dashes among the rocks of its stony bed, and the
singing of a thousand birds hidden in the dense
foliage of the valley; it is truly a nest of loves, a
hanging alcove where to go and dream of an aÃ«rial
balcony to which one might climb and thank God
for being happy.</p>

<p>"Ah, Gongora," I exclaimed after contemplating
for some moments that enchanting spectacle, "I
would give years of my life to be able to summon
here, with a stroke of a magic wand, all the dear
ones who are looking for me in Italy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>Gongora pointed out a large space on the wall, all
black with dates and names of visitors to the Alhambra,
written with crayon and charcoal and cut
with knives.</p>

<p>"What is this written here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I approached and uttered a cry: "Chateaubriand!"</p>

<p>"And here?"</p>

<p>"Byron!"</p>

<p>"And here?"</p>

<p>"Victor Hugo!"</p>

<p>After descending from the <i>Mirador de la Reina</i> I
thought I had seen the Alhambra, and was so imprudent
as to tell my friend so. If he had had a stick
in his hand, I verily believe he would have struck
me; but, as he had not, he contented himself by
regarding me with the air of one demanding whether
or not I had lost my senses.</p>

<p>We returned to the Court of the Myrtles and
visited the rooms situated on the other side of the
Tower of Comares, the greater part in ruins, the rest
altered, some absolutely bare, without either pavement
or roof, but all worth seeing, both in remembrance
of what they had been and for the sake of
understanding the plan of the edifice. The ancient
mosque was converted into a chapel by Charles V., and
a great Moorish hall was changed into an oratory;
here and there one still sees the fragments of arabesques
and carved ceilings of cedar-wood; the gal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>leries,
the courts, and the vestibules remind one of a
palace dismantled by fire.</p>

<p>After seeing that part of the Alhambra I really
thought there was nothing else left to see, and a
second time was imprudent enough to say so to Gongora:
this time he could no longer contain himself,
and, leading me into a vestibule of the Court of Myrtles
and pointing to a map of the building hanging on
the wall, he said, "Look, and you will see that all the
rooms of the courts and the towers that we have so
far visited do not occupy one-twentieth part of the
space embraced within the walls of the Alhambra;
you will see that we have not yet visited the remains
of the three other mosques, the ruins of the House of
Cadi, the water-tower, the tower of the Infantas, the
tower of the Prisoner, the tower of Candil, the tower
of the Picos, the tower of the Daggers, the tower of
the <i>Siete Suelos</i>, the tower of the Captain, the tower
of the Witch, the tower of the Heads, the tower of
Arms, the tower of the Hidalgos, the tower of the
Cocks, the tower of the Cube, the tower of Homage,
the tower of Vela, the Powder Tower, the remains
of the House of Mondejar, the military quarters,
the iron gate, the inner walls, the cisterns, the
promenades; for I would have you know that the
Alhambra is not a palace: it is a city, and one
could spend his life in studying its arabesques,
reading its inscriptions, and every day discovering
a new view of the hills and mountains, and going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
into ecstasies regularly once every twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>And I thought I had seen the Alhambra!</p>

<p>On that day I did not wish to learn anything
more, and the dear knows how my head ached when
I returned to the hotel. The day after, at the peep
of dawn, I was back at the Alhambra, and again in
the evening, and I continued to go there every day
so long as I remained at Granada, with Gongora,
with other friends, with guides, or alone; and the Alhambra
always seemed vaster and more beautiful
as I wandered through the courts and halls, and
passed hour after hour sitting among the columns or
gazing out of the windows with an ever-heightening
pleasure, every time discovering new beauties, and
ever abandoning myself to those vague and delightful
fancies among which my mind had strayed on the
first day. I cannot tell through which entrances my
friends led me into the Alhambra, but I remember
that every day on going there I saw walls and towers
and deserted streets that I had not seen before, and
the Alhambra seemed to me to have changed its site,
to have been transformed, and surrounded as if by
enchantment with new buildings that changed its
original appearance. Who could describe the beauty
of those sunset views; those fantastic groves flooded
with moonlight; the immense plain and the snow-covered
mountains on clear, serene nights; the imposing
outlines of those enormous walls, superb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
towers, and those measureless trees under a starry
sky; the prolonged rustling of those vast masses of
verdure overflowing the valleys and climbing the
hillsides? It was a spectacle before which my companions
remained speechless, although they were
born in Granada and accustomed from infancy to
look upon these scenes. So we would walk along in
silence, each buried in his own thoughts, with hearts
oppressed by mild melancholy, and sometimes our
eyes were wet with tears, and we raised our faces to
heaven with a burst of gratitude and love.</p>

<p>On the day of my arrival at Granada, when I
entered the hotel at midnight, instead of finding
silence and quiet, I found the <i>patio</i> illuminated like
a ball-room, people sipping sherbet at the tables,
coming and going along the galleries, laughing and
talking, and I was obliged to wait an hour before
going to sleep. But I passed that hour very pleasantly.
While I stood looking at a map of Spain on
the wall a great burly fellow, with a face as red as a
beet and a great stomach extending nearly to his
knees, approached me and, touching his cap, asked
if I was an Italian. I replied that I was, and he
continued with a smile, "And so am I; I am the
proprietor of the hotel."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it, the more so because
I see you are making money."</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" he replied in a tone which he
wished to seem melancholy. "Yes, ... I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
complain; but, ... believe me, my dear sir, however
well things may go, when one is far from his
native land one always feels a void here;" and he
put his hand upon his enormous chest.</p>

<p>I looked at his stomach.</p>

<p>"A great void," repeated mine host; "one never
forgets one's country.... From what province are
you, sir?"</p>

<p>"From Liguria. And you?"</p>

<p>"From Piedmont. Liguria! Piedmont! Lombardy!
They are countries!"</p>

<p>"They are fine countries, there is no doubt of
that, but, after all, you cannot complain of Spain.
You are living in one of the most beautiful cities in
the world, and are proprietor of one of the finest
hotels in the city; you have a crowd of guests all
the year round, and then I see you enjoy enviable
health."</p>

<p>"But the void?"</p>

<p>I looked again at his stomach.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, sir; but you are deceived, you know,
if you judge me by appearances. You cannot imagine
what a pleasure it is when an Italian comes here.
What you will? Weakness it may be.... I know
not, ... but I should like to see him every day at
table, and I believe that if my wife did not laugh at
me I should send him a dozen dishes on my own
account, as a foretaste."</p>

<p>"At what hour do you dine to-morrow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>"At five. But, after all, ... one eats little
here, ... hot country, ... everybody lives lightly, ...
whatever their nationality may be.... That
is the rule.... But you have not seen the other
Italian who is here?"</p>

<p>So saying, he turned around, and a man came
forward from a corner of the court where he had
been watching us. The proprietor, after a few
words, left us alone. The stranger was a man of
about forty, miserably dressed, who spoke through
closed teeth, and kept continually clenching his
hands with a convulsive motion as if he was making
an effort to keep from using his fists. He told me
he was a chorus-singer from Lombardy, and that he
had arrived the day before at Granada with other
artists booked to sing at the opera for the summer
season.</p>

<p>"A beastly country!" he exclaimed without any
preamble, looking around as if he wished to make
a speech.</p>

<p>"Then you do not remain in Spain voluntarily?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"In Spain? I? Excuse me: it is just as if you
had asked me whether I was staying voluntarily in a
galley."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Why? But can't you see what sort of people the
Spaniards are&mdash;ignorant, superstitious, proud, bloodthirsty,
impostors, thieves, charlatans, villains?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>And he stood a moment motionless in a questioning
attitude, with the veins of his neck so swollen that
they seemed ready to burst.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I replied; "your judgment does
not seem favorable enough to admit of my agreeing
with you. When it comes to ignorance, excuse me,
it will not do for us Italians, for us who still have
cities where the schoolmasters are stoned and the
professors are stabbed if they give a zero to their
scholars,&mdash;it will not do for us, I say, to pick flaws
in others. As for superstition, alas for us again!
since we may still see in that city of Italy in which
popular instruction is most widely diffused an unspeakable
uproar over a miraculous image of the
Madonna found by a poor ignorant woman in the
middle of a street! As for crime, I frankly declare
that if I were obliged to draw a comparison between
the two countries before an audience of Spaniards,
with the statistics now in hand, without first proving
my data and conclusions, I should be very much
alarmed.... I do not wish to say by this that
we are not, on the whole, sailing in smoother water
than is Spain. I wish to say that an Italian in
judging the Spanish, if he would be just, must be
indulgent."</p>

<p>"Excuse me: I don't think so. A country without
political direction! a country a prey to anarchy!
a country&mdash;Come, now, cite me one great Spaniard
of the present day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>"I cannot, ... there are so few great men anywhere."</p>

<p>"Cite me a Galileo."</p>

<p>"Oh, there are no Galileos."</p>

<p>"Cite me a Ratazzi."</p>

<p>"Well, they have none."</p>

<p>"Cite me ... But, really, they have nothing.
And then, does the country seem beautiful to you?"</p>

<p>"Ah! excuse me; that point I will not yield:
Andalusia, to cite a single province, is a paradise;
Seville, Cadiz, and Granada are splendid cities."</p>

<p>"How? Do you like the houses of Seville and
Cadiz, with walls that whiten a poor devil from head
to foot whenever he happens to touch them? Do
you like those streets along which one can hardly
pass after a good dinner? And do you find the Andalusian
women beautiful with their devilish eyes?
Come, now, you are too indulgent. They are not a
<i>serious</i> people. They have summoned Don Amadeus,
and now they don't want him. They are not worthy
of being governed by a <i>civilized man</i>." (These were
his actual words.)</p>

<p>"Then you don't find any good in Spain?"</p>

<p>"Not the least."</p>

<p>"But why do you stay?"</p>

<p>"I stay ... because I make my living here."</p>

<p>"Well, that is something."</p>

<p>"But what a living! It is a dog's life! Everybody
knows what Spanish cooking is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>"Excuse me: instead of living like a dog in
Spain, why not go and live like a man in Italy?"</p>

<p>Here the poor artist seemed somewhat disconcerted,
and I, to relieve his annoyance, offered him a
cigar, which he took and lighted without a word.
And he was not the only Italian in Spain who had
spoken to me in those terms of the country and its
inhabitants, denying even the clearness of the sky
and the grace of the Andalusian women. I do not
know what enjoyment there can be in travelling
after this fashion, with the heart closed to every
kindly sentiment, and continually on the lookout to
censure and despise, as if everything good and
beautiful which one finds in a foreign country has
been stolen from our own, and as if we are of no
account unless we run down everybody else. The
people who travel in such a mental attitude make
me pity rather than condemn them, because they
voluntarily deprive themselves of many pleasures
and comforts. So it appears to me, at least, to
judge others by myself, for wherever I go the first
sentiment which the sights and the people inspire
in me is a feeling of sympathy; a desire not to find
anything which I shall be obliged to censure; an inclination
to imagine every beautiful thing more beautiful;
to conceal the unpleasant things, to excuse the
defects, to be able to say candidly to myself and
others that I am content with everything and everybody.
And to arrive at this end I do not have to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
any effort: everything presents itself almost spontaneously
in its most pleasing aspect, and my imagination
benignly paints the other aspects a delicate
rose-color. I know well that one cannot study a
country in this way, nor write sage essays, nor
acquire fame as a profound thinker; but I know
that one travels with a peaceful mind, and that such
travels are of unspeakable benefit.</p>

<p>The next day I went to see the Generalife, which
was a sort of villa of the Moorish kings, and whose
name is linked to that of the Alhambra as is that
of the Alhambra to Granada; but now only a few
arches and arabesques remain of the ancient Generalife.
It is a small palace, simple and white, with
few windows, and an arched gallery surrounded with
a terrace, and half hidden in the midst of a grove
of laurel and myrtles, standing on the summit of a
mountain covered with flowers, rising upon the right
bank of the Darro opposite the hill of the Alhambra.
In front of the faÃ§ade of the palace extends a little
garden, and other gardens rise one above another
almost in the form of a vast staircase to the very
top of the mountain, where there extends a very
high terrace that encloses the Generalife. The
avenues of the gardens and the wide staircases that
lead from one to another of the flower-beds are
flanked by high espaliers surmounted by arches and
divided by arbors of myrtle, curved and intertwined
with graceful designs, and at every landing-place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
rise white summer-houses shaded by trellises and
picturesque groups of orange trees and cypresses.
Water is still as abundant as in Moorish times,
and gives the place a grace, freshness, and luxuriance
impossible to describe. From every part
one hears the murmur of rivulets and fountains;
one turns down an avenue and finds a jet of water;
one approaches a window and sees a stream
reaching almost to the window-sill; one enters
a group of trees and the spray of a little waterfall
strikes one's face; one turns and sees water
leaping, running, and trickling through the grass
and shrubbery.</p>

<p>From the height of the terrace one commands
a view of all those gardens as they slope downward
in platforms and terraces; one peers down into
the abyss of vegetation which separates the two
mountains; one overlooks the whole enclosure of
the Alhambra, with the cupolas of its little temples,
its distant towers, and the paths winding among its
ruins; the view extends over the city of Granada
with its plain and its hills, and runs with a single
glance along all the summits of the Sierra Nevada,
that appear so near that one imagines they are not
an hour's walk distant. And while you contemplate
that spectacle your ear is soothed by the murmur
of a hundred fountains and the faint sound of the
bells of the city, which comes in waves scarcely
audible, bearing with it the mysterious fragrance of
this earthly paradise which makes you tremble and
grow pale with delight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"><i><a id="Court_of_the_Generalife"></a>Court of the Generalife, Granada</i></div>
<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b226cs.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>Beyond the Generalife, on the summit of a
higher mountain, now bleak and bare, there rose
in Moorish times other royal palaces, with gardens
connected with each other by great avenues
lined with myrtle hedges. Now all these marvels
of architecture encircled by groves, fountains,
and flowers, those fabulous castles in the air, those
magnificent and fragrant nests of love and delight,
have disappeared, and scarcely a heap of rubbish or
a short stretch of wall remains to tell their story to
the passer-by. But these ruins, that elsewhere
would arouse a feeling of melancholy, do not have
such an influence in the presence of that glorious
nature whose enchantment not even the most marvellous
works of man have ever been able to equal.</p>

<p>On re-entering the city I stopped at one end of the
<i>Carrera del Darro</i>, in front of a house richly adorned
with bas-reliefs representing heraldic shields, armor,
cherubs, and lions, with a little balcony, over one
corner of which, partly on one wall and partly on
another, I read the following mysterious inscription
stamped in great letters:</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Esperando la del Cielo</span>,"</p>

<p>which, literally translated, signifies "<i>Awaiting her
in Heaven</i>." Curious to learn the hidden meaning of
those words, I made a note of them, so that I might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
ask the learned father of my friend about them. He
gave me two interpretations, the one almost certainly
correct, but not at all romantic; the other romantic,
but very doubtful. I give the last: The house
belonged to Don Fernando de Zafra, the secretary of
the Catholic kings. He had a very beautiful daughter.
A young hidalgo, of a family hostile or inferior in
rank to the house of Zafra, became enamored of the
daughter, and, as his love was returned, he asked for
her hand in marriage, but was refused. The refusal
of her father stirred the love of the two young hearts
to flame: the windows of the house were low; the
lover one night succeeded in making the ascent and
entered the maiden's room. Whether he upset a
chair on entering, or coughed, or uttered a low cry
of joy on seeing his beautiful love welcoming him
with open arms, the tradition does not tell, and no
one knows; but certain it is that Don Fernando de
Zafra heard a noise, ran in, saw, and, blind with
fury, rushed upon the ill-fated young man to put
him to death. But he succeeded in making his escape,
and Don Fernando in following him ran into
one of his own pages, a partisan of the lovers, who
had helped the hidalgo to enter the house: in his
haste his master mistook him for the betrayer, and,
without hearing his protests and prayers, he had him
bound and hanged from the balcony. The tradition
runs that while the poor victim kept crying, "Pity!
pity!" the outraged father responded as he pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
toward the balcony, "Thou shalt stay there <i>esperando
la del Cielo</i>!" (awaiting her in heaven)&mdash;a reply
which he afterward had cut in the stone walls as
a perpetual warning to evil-doers.</p>

<p>I devoted the rest of the day to the churches and
monasteries.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Granada deserves to be described
part by part in an even higher degree than the cathedral
of Malaga, although it too is beautiful and
magnificent; but I have already described enough
churches. Its foundation was laid by the Catholic
kings in 1529 upon the ruins of the principal mosque
of the city, but it has never been finished. It has a
great faÃ§ade with three doorways, adorned with
statues and bas-reliefs, and it consists of five naves,
divided by twenty measureless pilasters, each composed
of a bundle of slender columns. The chapels
contain paintings by Boccanegra, sculptures by Torrigiano,
and tombs and other precious ornaments.
Admirable above all is the great chapel, supported
by twenty Corinthian columns divided into two
orders, upon the first of which rise colossal statues
of the twelve apostles, and on the second an entablature
covered with garlands and heads of cherubs.
Overhead runs a circle of magnificent stained-glass
windows, which represent the Passion, and from the
frieze which crowns them leap ten bold arches forming
the vault of the chapel. Within the arches that
support the columns are six great paintings by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Alonzo Cano, which are said to be his most beautiful
and finished work.</p>

<p>And since I have spoken of Alonzo Cano, a native
of Granada, one of the strongest Spanish painters of
the seventeenth century, although a disciple of the
Sevillian school rather than the founder, as some
assert, of a school of his own, but less original than
his greatest contemporaries,&mdash;since I have spoken of
him, I wish here to record some traits of his genius
and anecdotes of his life little known outside of Spain,
although exceedingly remarkable. Alonzo Cano was
the most quarrelsome, the most irascible, and the
most violent of the Spanish painters. He spent his
life in contention. He was a priest. From 1652 to
1658, for six consecutive years, without a day's intermission,
he wrangled with the canons of the cathedral
of Granada, of which he was steward, because
he was not willing to become subdeacon in accordance
with the stipulated agreement; before leaving
Granada he broke into pieces with his own hands a
statue of Saint Anthony of Padua which he had
made to the order of an auditor of the chancery,
because the man allowed himself to observe that the
price demanded seemed a little dear. Chosen master
of design to the royal prince, who, as it appears,
was not born with a talent for painting, he so exasperated
his pupil that the boy was obliged to have
recourse to the king that he might be taken out of
his hands. Remanded to Granada, to the neighbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>hood
of the chapter of the cathedral, as an especial
favor, he bore such a deep rancor from his old litigations
with his canons that throughout his life he
would not do a stroke of work for them. But this
is a small matter. He nursed a blind, bestial, inextinguishable
hatred against the Hebrews, and was
firmly convinced that in any way to touch a Hebrew
or any object that a Hebrew had touched
would bring him misfortune. Owing to this conviction
he did some of the most extravagant feats in
the world. If in walking along the street he ran
against a Jew, he would strip off the infected garment
and return home in his shirt-sleeves. If by
chance he succeeded in discovering that in his absence
a servant had admitted a Jew into the house,
he discharged the servant, threw away the shoes
with which he had touched the pavement profaned
by the circumcised, and sometimes even had the
pavement torn up and reset. And he found something
to find fault with even as he was dying.
When he was approaching the end of life the confessor
handed him a clumsily-made crucifix that he
might kiss it, but he pushed it away with his hand,
saying, "Father, give me a naked cross, that I may
worship Jesus Christ as He Himself is and as I behold
Him in my mind." But, after all, his was a
rare, charitable nature which abhorred every vulgar
action, and loved with a deep and very pure love the
art in which he remains immortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>On returning to the church after I had made the
round of all the chapels and was preparing to leave,
I was impressed by a suspicion that there was something
else still to be seen. I had not read the Guidebook
and had been told nothing, but I heard an
inner voice which said to me, "Seek!" and, in fact,
I sought with my eyes in every direction, without
knowing what I sought. A cicerone noticed me and
sidled up to me, as all of his kind do, like an assassin,
and asked me with an air of mystery, "<i>Quiere
usted algo?</i>" (Do you wish something, sir?)</p>

<p>"I should like to know," I replied, "if there is
anything to see in this cathedral besides that which
I have seen already?"</p>

<p>"How!" exclaimed the cicerone; "you have not
seen the royal chapel, have you, sir?"</p>

<p>"What is there in the royal chapel?"</p>

<p>"What is there? Caramba! Nothing less than
the tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholics."</p>

<p>I could have said so! I had in my mind a place
ready for this idea, and the idea was lacking! The
Catholic kings must certainly have been buried in
Granada, where they fought the last great chivalrous
war of the Middle Ages, and where they gave Christopher
Columbus a commission to fit out ships which
bore him to the New World. I ran rather than
walked to the royal chapel, preceded by the limping
cicerone; an old sacristan opened the door of the
sacristy, and before he allowed me to enter and see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the tombs he led me to a sort of glass cupboard full
of precious objects, and said to me, "You will remember
that Isabella the Catholic, to furnish Christopher
Columbus with the money that he needed to
supply the ships for the voyage, not knowing where
to turn because the coffers of the state were empty,
put her jewels in pawn."</p>

<p>"Yes: well?" I demanded impatiently; and, divining
the answer, felt my heart beat faster the
while.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the sacristan, "that is the box in
which the queen locked her jewels to send them to
be pawned."</p>

<p>And so saying he opened the cupboard and took
out the box and handed it to me.</p>

<p>Oh! brave men may say what they will; as for
me, there are things that make me tremble and
weep. I have touched the box that contained the
treasure by which Columbus was enabled to discover
America. Every time I repeat those words my
blood is stirred, and I add, "I have touched it with
these hands," and I look at my hands.</p>

<p>That cupboard contains also the sword of King
Ferdinand, the crown and sceptre of Isabella, a missal
and some other ornaments of the king and queen.</p>

<p>We entered the chapel. Between the altar and a
great iron chancel that separates it from the remaining
space stand two great mausoleums of marble
adorned with statuettes and bas-reliefs of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
value. Upon one of them lie the statues of Ferdinand
and Isabella in their royal robes, with crown,
sword, and sceptre; on the other the statues of the
other two princes of Spain, and around the statues
lions, angels, and arms, and various ornaments, presenting
a regal appearance, austere and magnificent.</p>

<p>The sacristan lighted a flambeau, and, pointing
out a sort of trap-door in the pavement between the
two mausoleums, asked me to open it and descend
into the subterranean chamber. With the cicerone's
aid I opened the trap-door; the sacristan descended,
and I followed him down a narrow little staircase
until we reached a little room. There were five
caskets of lead, bound with iron bands, each sealed
with two initials under a crown. The sacristan
lowered the torch, and, touching all five of them,
one after another, with his hand, said in a slow,
solemn voice,</p>

<p>"Here rests the great queen Isabella the Catholic.</p>

<p>"Here rests the great king Ferdinand V.</p>

<p>"Here rests the king Philip I.</p>

<p>"Here rests Queen Joanna the Mad.</p>

<p>"Here rests Lady Maria, her daughter, who died
at the age of nine years.</p>

<p>"God keep them all in his holy peace!"</p>

<p>And, placing the torch on the ground, he crossed
his arms and closed his eyes, as if to give me time
for meditation.</p>

<p>One would become a hunchback at his desk if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
were to describe all the religious monuments of
Granada&mdash;the stupendous Cartuja; the Monte Sacro,
containing the grottoes of the martyrs; the church
of San Geronimo, where the great leader Gonzalez
di Cordova is buried; the convent of Santo Domingo,
founded by Torquemada the Inquisitor; the
convent of the Angels, containing paintings by
Cano and Murillo and many others; but I suppose
that my readers may be even more weary than I am,
and will consequently pardon me for passing by a
mountain of description which probably would only
give them a confused idea of the things described.</p>

<p>But as I have mentioned the sepulchre of the
great commander, Gonzalez di Cordova, I cannot
forbear translating a curious document in reference
to him which was shown me in the church of San
Geronimo by a sacristan who was an admirer of the
deeds of that hero. The document, in the form of
an anecdote, is as follows:</p>

<p>"Every step of the great captain Don Gonzalez
di Cordova was an assault, and every assault a victory;
his sepulchre in the convent of the Geronomites
at Granada was adorned with two hundred
banners which he had taken. His envious rivals,
and the treasurers of the kingdom of Naples in particular,
induced the king in 1506 to demand a statement
from Gonzalez of the use he had made of the
great sums received from Spain for the conduct of
the war in Italy; and, in fact, the king was so small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
as to consent, and even to be present on the occasion
of the conference.</p>

<p>"Gonzalez acceded to the demand with the
haughtiest disdain, and proposed to give a severe
lesson to the treasurers and the king upon the treatment
and consideration to be accorded a conqueror
of kingdoms.</p>

<p>"He replied with great indifference and calmness
that he would prepare his accounts for the following
day, and would let it appear which was the debtor,
himself or the exchequer, which demanded an account
of one hundred and thirty thousand ducats
delivered upon the first payment, eighty thousand
crowns upon the second, three millions upon the
third, eleven millions upon the fourth, thirteen millions
upon the fifth, and so on as the solemn, nasal,
foolish secretary who authorized so important an act
continued to enumerate the sums.</p>

<p>"The great Gonzalez kept his word, presented
himself at the second audience, and, bringing out a
voluminous book in which he had noted his justification,
he began with the following words in a deep,
sonorous voice:</p>

<p>"'Two hundred thousand seven hundred and
thirty-six ducats and nine reales to the fathers, the
nuns, and the poor, to the end that they might pray
God for the triumph of the Spanish arms.</p>

<p>"'One hundred thousand ducats for powder and
shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>"'Ten thousand ducats for perfumed gloves to
protect the soldiers from the stench of the corpses
of the enemy left on the field of battle.</p>

<p>"'One hundred and seventy thousand ducats for
renewing bells worn out by continuous ringing for
constant new victories over the enemy.</p>

<p>"'Fifty thousand ducats for brandy for the soldiers
on the day of battle.</p>

<p>"'A million and a half ducats for the maintenance
of the prisoners and wounded.</p>

<p>"'A million for returning thanks and Te Deums
to the Omnipotent.</p>

<p>"'Three hundred millions in masses for the dead.</p>

<p>"'Seven hundred thousand four hundred and
ninety-four ducats for spies and ...</p>

<p>"'One hundred millions for the patience which I
showed yesterday on hearing that the king demanded
an account from the man who has given him his
kingdom.'</p>

<p>"These are the celebrated accounts of the great
captain, the originals of which are in the possession
of Count d'Altimira.</p>

<p>"One of the original accounts, with the autograph
seal of the great captain, exists in the Military
Museum of London, where it is guarded with great
care."</p>

<p>On reading this document I returned to the hotel,
making invidious comparisons between Gonzalez di
Cordova and the Spanish generals of our times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
which, for grave state reasons, as they say in the
tragedies, I dare not repeat.</p>

<p>In the hotel I saw something new every day.
There were many university students who had come
from Malaga and other Andalusian cities to take the
examination for the doctor's degree at Granada,
whether because they were a little easier there or
for what other reason I do not know. We all ate
at a round table. One morning at breakfast one of
the students, a young man of about twenty, announced
that at two o'clock he was to be examined
in canon law, and that, not feeling very sure of himself,
he had decided to take a glass of wine to refresh
the springs of eloquence. He was accustomed to
drink only wine weakened with water, and committed
the imprudence of emptying at a single
draught a glass of the vintage of Xerez. His face
changed in an instant in so strange a manner that if
I had not seen the transformation with my own eyes
I should not have believed that he was the same
person.</p>

<p>"There! that is enough!" cried his friends.</p>

<p>But the young man, who already felt that he had
become suddenly strong, keen, and confident, cast a
compassionate glance at his companions, and with
a lordly gesture ordered the waiter to fetch him
another glass.</p>

<p>"You will be drunk," they said.</p>

<p>His only response was to drain a second glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>Then he became wonderfully talkative. There
was a score of persons at table: in a few minutes he
was conversing with them all, and he revealed a
thousand secrets of his past life and his plans for
the future. He said that he was from Cadiz, that he
had eight thousand francs a year to spend, and that
he wished to devote himself to a diplomatic career,
because with that revenue, added to something
which his uncle would leave him, he should be able
to cut a good figure wherever he might be; that he
had decided to take a wife at thirty, and to marry a
woman as tall as himself, because it was his opinion
that the wife should be of the same stature as her
husband, to keep either from getting the upper hand
of the other; that when he was a boy he was in
love with the daughter of an American consul as
beautiful as a flower and strong as a pine, but she
had a red birth-mark behind one ear, which looked
badly, although she knew how to cover it very well
with her scarf, and he showed us with his napkin
how she covered it; and that Don Amadeus was too
ingenuous a man to succeed in governing Spain;
that of the poets Zorilla and Espronceda, he had
always preferred Espronceda; that it would be folly
to cede Cuba to America; that the examination on
canon law made him laugh; and that he wished to
drink another four fingers of Xerez, the finest wine
in Europe.</p>

<p>He drank a third glass in spite of the good coun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>sel
and disapprobation of his friends, and after prattling
a little longer amid the laughter of his audience,
he suddenly became silent, looked fixedly at a
lady sitting opposite to him, dropped his head, and
fell asleep. I thought that he could not present himself
for the examination that day, but was mistaken.
A short hour later they awakened him; he went up
stairs to wash his face, ran off to the university still
drowsy, took his examination, and was promoted, to
the greater glory of the wine of Xerez and Spanish
diplomacy.</p>

<p>I devoted the following days to visiting the monuments,
or, to be more accurate, the ruins of the
Moorish monuments which besides the Alhambra
and the Generalife attest the ancient splendor of
Granada. Insomuch as it was the last bulwark of
Islam, Granada is the city which presents the most
numerous relics of all the cities of Spain. On the
hill called the hill of <i>Dinadamar</i> (the Fountain of
Tears) one may still see the ruins of four towers
rising at the four corners of a great cistern into
which flowed the waters from the Sierra to supply
the highest part of the city. There were baths, gardens,
and villas of which not a trace remains: from
that point one overlooked the city with its minarets,
its terraces, and its mosques gleaming among the
palms and cypresses. Near there one sees a Moorish
gate called the gate of Elvira&mdash;a great arch
crowned with battlements&mdash;and beyond it are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
ruins of the palaces of the caliphs. Near the Alameda
promenade stands a square tower in which
there is a great hall ornamented with the usual Arabian
inscriptions. Near the convent of San Domingo
are the remains of gardens and palaces once
joined to the Alhambra by a subterranean passage.
Within the city is the Alcaiceria, a Moorish market
almost perfectly preserved, formed of a few little
streets as straight and narrow as corridors, lined
with two rows of shops, one adjoining the other, and
presenting the strange appearance of an Asiatic
bazaar. In short, one cannot take a step in Granada
without coming face to face with an arch, an
arabesque, a column, or a pile of stones which suggests
its fantastic, luxurious past.</p>

<p>What turns and windings have I not made through
those tortuous streets at the hottest hour of the day,
under a sun that shrivelled my brain, without meeting
a living soul! At Granada, as in the other
cities of Andalusia, the people are alive only at
night, and the night repays them for the imprisonment
of the day; the public promenades are crowded
and confused by the hurry and jostling of a multitude,
one half of which seems to be seeking the
other half upon urgent business. The crowd is
densest in the Alameda, but, for all that, I spent my
evenings on the Alameda with Gongora, who talked
to me of Moorish monuments, and with a journalist
who discoursed on politics, and also with another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
young man who talked of women, and frequently
with all three of them together, to my infinite
pleasure, because those cheery meetings, like those of
school-boys, at odd times and places, refreshed my
mind, to steal a beautiful simile, like a summer
shower refreshes the grass as it falls faster and
faster, dancing for joy.</p>

<p>If I were obliged to say something about the
people of Granada, I should be embarrassed, because
I have not seen them. In the day-time I met no
one in the streets, and at night I could not see them.
The theatres were not open, and when I might have
found some one in the city I was wandering through
the halls or avenues of the Alhambra; and then I
had so much to do to see everything in the short
time which I had allowed myself that no unoccupied
moments remained for those chance conversations,
like the ones I had in the other cities, in the streets
and the cafÃ©s, with whomever I happened to meet.</p>

<p>But from what I learned from men who were in
a position to give me trustworthy information, the
people of Granada do not enjoy an enviable reputation
in Spain. They are said to be ill-tempered,
violent, vindictive, and bloodthirsty; and this arraignment
is not disproved by the pages of the city
newspapers. It is not publicly stated, but every one
knows it for a fact, that popular instruction in Granada
is at a lower ebb than even in Seville and the
other smaller Spanish cities, and, as a rule, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>thing
that cannot be produced by the sun and the
soil, which produce so bountifully, goes to the bad,
either through indolence or ignorance or shiftlessness.
Granada is not connected by railway with
any important city: she lives alone, surrounded by
her gardens, enclosed by her mountains, happy with
the fruits which Nature produces under her hand,
gently lulling herself to sleep in the vanity of her
beauty and the pride of her history&mdash;idle, drowsy,
and fanciful, content to answer with a yawn to any
one who reproves her for her condition: "I gave
Spain the painter Alonzo Cano, the poet Louis de
Leon, the historian Fernando de Castillo, the sacred
orator Luis di Grenada, and the minister Martinez
de la Rosas. I have paid my debt, leave me in
peace;" and this is the reply made by almost all the
southern cities of Spain, more beautiful, alas! than
wise and industrious, and proud rather than civilized.
Ah! one who has seen them can never have
done exclaiming, "What a pity!"</p>

<p>"Now that you have seen all the marvels of Moorish
art and tropical vegetation there remains the suburb
of the Albaicin to be seen before you can say
that you know Granada. Prepare your mind for a
new world, put your hand on your purse, and follow
me."</p>

<p>So said Gongora to me on the last evening of my
sojourn in Granada. A Republican journalist was
with us, Melchiorre Almago by name, the director<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
of the <i>Idea</i>, a congenial, affable young man, who to
accompany us sacrificed his dinner and a leading
article that he had been cogitating since morning.</p>

<p>We walked on until we came to the square of the
<i>Audiencia</i>. There Gongora pointed out an alley
winding up a hill, and said to me, "Here commences
the Albaicin;" and SeÃ±or Melchiorre, touching
a house with his cane, added, "Here commences
the territory of the republic."</p>

<p>We turned up the alley, passed from it into another,
and from that into a third, always ascending,
without my seeing anything extraordinary, although
I looked curiously in every direction. Narrow streets,
squalid houses, old women dozing on the doorsteps,
mothers carefully inspecting their children's heads,
gaping dogs, crowing cocks, ragged boys running
and shouting, and the other things that one always
sees in the suburbs; but in those streets nothing
more. But gradually, as we ascended, the appearance
of the houses and the people began to change;
the roofs became lower, the windows fewer, the doors
smaller, and the people more ragged. In the middle
of every street ran a little stream in a walled gutter,
in the Moorish style; here and there over the doors
and around the windows one saw the remains of arabesques
and fragments of columns, and in the corners
of the squares fountains and well-curbs of the
time of the Moorish dominion. At every hundred
steps it seemed as if we had gone back fifty years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
toward the age of the caliphs. My two companions
touched me on the elbow from time to time, saying
as they did so, "Look at that old woman!"&mdash;"Look
at that little girl!"&mdash;"Look at that man!" and I
looked, and asked, "Who are these people?" If I
had unexpectedly found myself in that place, I
should have believed on seeing those men and
women that I was in an African village, so strange
were the faces, the dress, the manner of moving,
talking, and looking, at so short a distance from the
centre of Granada&mdash;so different were they from the
people that I had seen up to that time. At every
turn I stopped to look in the face of my companions,
and they answered, "That is nothing; we are now
in the civilized part of the Albaicin; this is the
Parisian quarter of the suburb; let us go on."</p>

<p>We went on, and the streets seemed like the bed
of a torrent&mdash;paths hollowed out among the rocks,
all banks and gullies, broken and stony&mdash;some so
steep that a mule could not climb them, others so
narrow that a man could scarcely pass; some
blocked by women and children sitting on the
ground, others grass-grown and deserted; and all so
squalid, wild, and uncouth that the most wretched of
our villages cannot give one an idea of them, because
this is a poverty that bears the impress of
another race and another continent. We turned
into a labyrinth of streets, passing from time to
time under a great Moorish arch or through a high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
square from which one commanded a view of the
wide valleys, the snow-covered mountains, and a
part of the lower city, until finally we arrived at a
street rougher and narrower than any we had yet
seen; and there we stopped to take breath.</p>

<p>"Here commences the real Albaicin," said the
young archeologist. "Look at that house!"</p>

<p>I looked; it was a low, smoke-stained, ruinous
house, with a door that seemed like the mouth of a
cavern, before which one saw, under a mass of rags,
a group, or rather a heap, of old women and little
children, who upon our approach raised their eyes
heavy with sleep, and with bony hands removed
from the threshold some filth which impeded our
passage.</p>

<p>"Let us enter," said my friend.</p>

<p>"Enter?" I demanded.</p>

<p>If they had told me that beyond those walls there
was a facsimile of the famous Court of Miracles
which Victor Hugo has described, I should not have
doubted their word. No door has ever said more
emphatically than that, "Stand back!" I cannot
find a better comparison than the gaping mouth of
a gigantic witch breathing out pestilential vapors.
But I took courage and entered.</p>

<p>Oh, marvellous! It was the court of a Moorish
house surrounded by graceful little columns surmounted
by lovely arches, with those indescribable
traceries of the Alhambra along the porticoes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
around the mullioned windows, with the beams and
ceiling carved and enamelled with little niches for
vases of flowers and urns of perfume, with a pool
in the middle, and all the traces and memorials of
the delicate life of an opulent family. And in that
house lived those wretched people!</p>

<p>We went out and entered other houses, in all of
which I found some fragments of Moorish architecture
and sculpture. From time to time Gongora
would say to me, "This was a harem. Those were
the baths of the women; up yonder was the chamber
of a favorite;" and I fixed my eyes upon every
bit of the arabesqued wall and upon all the little
columns of the windows, as if to ask them for a revelation
of their secrets&mdash;only a name or a magic
word with which I might reconstruct in an instant
the ruined edifice and summon the beautiful Arabians
who had dwelt there. But, alas! amid the
columns and under the arches of the windows there
were only rags and wrinkled faces.</p>

<p>Among other houses, we entered one where we
found a group of girls sewing under the shade of a
tree in the courtyard, directed by an old woman.
They were all working upon a great piece of cloth
that seemed like a mat or a bed-spread, in black and
gray stripes. I approached and asked one of the
girls, "What is this?"</p>

<p>They all looked up and with a concerted movement
spread the cloth open, so that I could see their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
work plainly. Almost before I had seen it I cried,
"I will buy it."</p>

<p>They all began to laugh. It was the mantle of an
Andalusian mountaineer, made to wear in the saddle,
rectangular in form, with an opening in the middle
to put one's head through, embroidered in bright-colored
worsteds along the two shortest sides and
around the opening. The design of the embroideries,
which represented birds and fantastic flowers,
green, blue, white, red, and yellow, all in a mass,
was as crude as a pattern a child might make: the
beauty of the work lay altogether in the harmony
of the colors, which was truly marvellous. I cannot
express the sensation produced by the sight of that
mantle, except by saying that it laughed and filled
one with its cheerfulness; and it seems to me impossible
to imagine anything gayer, more festive, or
more childishly and gracefully capricious. It was a
thing to look upon in order to bring yourself out of
a bad humor, or when you wish to write a pretty
verse in a lady's album, or when you are expecting
a person whom you wish to receive with your
brightest smile.</p>

<p>"When will you finish these embroideries?" I
asked one of the girls.</p>

<p>"<i>Hoy mismo</i>" (to-day), they all replied in chorus.</p>

<p>"And what is the mantle worth?"</p>

<p>"<i>Cinco</i>" (five), stammered one.</p>

<p>The old women pierced her with a glance which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
seemed to say, "Blockhead!" and answered hastily,
"Six <i>duros</i>."</p>

<p>Six <i>duros</i> are thirty francs; it did not seem much
to me, and I put my hand in my pocket.</p>

<p>Gongora cast a withering glance at me which
seemed to say, "You simpleton!" and, drawing me
back by the arm, said, "One moment: six <i>duros</i> is
an exorbitant price."</p>

<p>The old woman shot him another glance which
seemed to say, "Brigand!" and replied, "I cannot
take less."</p>

<p>Gongora gave her another glance, which seemed
to say, "Liar!" and said, "Come, now; you can
take four <i>duros</i>; you would not ask more from the
country-people."</p>

<p>The old woman insisted, and for a while we continued
to exchange with our eyes the titles of simpleton,
swindler, marplot, liar, pinch-penny, spend-thrift,
until the mantle was sold to me for five duros,
and I paid and left my address, and we went out
blessed and commended to God by the old woman
and followed a good way by the black eyes of the
embroiderers.</p>

<p>We went on from street to street, among houses
increasingly wretched and growing blacker and
blacker, and more revolting rags and faces. But
we never came to the end, and I asked my companions,
"Will you have the goodness to tell me if Granada
has any limits, and if so where they are?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
May one ask where we are going and how we shall
return home?" But they simply laughed and went
forward.</p>

<p>"Is there anything stranger than this to be seen?"
I asked at a certain point.</p>

<p>"Stranger?" they both replied. "This second
part of the suburb which you have seen still belongs
to civilization: if not the Parisian, it is at least the
Madrid, quarter of the Albaicin, and there <i>is</i> something
else; let us go on."</p>

<p>We passed through a very small street containing
some scantily-clothed women, who looked like people
fallen from the moon; crossed a little square full of
babies and pigs in friendly confusion; passed through
two or three other alleys, now climbing, now descending,
now in the midst of houses, now among piles of
rubbish, now between trees and now among rocks,
until we finally arrived at the solitary place on a
hillside from which we saw in front the Generalife,
to the right the Alhambra, and below a deep valley
filled with a dense wood.</p>

<p>It was growing dark; no one was in sight and not
a voice was heard.</p>

<p>"Is this the end of the suburb?" I asked.</p>

<p>My two companions laughed and said, "Look in
that direction."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption"> <i><a id="The_Alhambra"></a>The Alhambra and the Valley of
the Darro</i></div>
<div class="nobreak"><img src="images/illus-b250cs.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p>I turned and saw along the street that was lost in
a distant grove an interminable row of houses. Of
houses? Rather of dens dug in the earth, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
bit of wall in front, with holes for windows and crevices
for doors, and wild plants of every sort on top
and along the sides&mdash;veritable caves of beasts, in
which by the glow of faint lights, scarcely visible,
swarmed the gypsies by hundreds; a people multiplying
in the bowels of the mountain, poorer, blacker, and
more savage than any seen before; another city,
unknown to the greater part of Granada, inaccessible
to the police, closed to the census-officers, ignorant
of every law and of all government, living
one knows not how, how numerous no one knows,
foreign to the city, to Spain, and to modern civilization,
with a language and statutes and manners of
their own&mdash;superstitious, false, thieving, beggarly,
and fierce.</p>

<p>"Button up your coat and look out for your
watch," said Gongora to me, "and let us go forward."</p>

<p>We had not taken a hundred steps when a half-naked
boy, black as the walls of his hovel, ran out,
gave a cry, and, making a sign to the other boys
who followed him, dashed toward us; behind the
boys came the women; behind the women the men,
and then old men, old women, and more children;
and in less time than it takes to tell it we were surrounded
by a crowd. My two friends, recognized as
Granadines, succeeded in saving themselves; I was
left in the lurch. I can still see those horrid faces,
still hear those voices, and still feel the pressure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
those hands: gesticulating, shouting, saying a thousand
things which I did not understand; dragging at
my coat, my waistcoat, and my sleeves, they pressed
upon me like a pack of famished people, breathed in
my face, and cut off my very breath. They were,
for the most part, half naked and emaciated&mdash;their
garments falling in tatters, with unkempt hair, horrible
to see; I seemed to be like Don Roderick in
the midst of a crowd of the infected in that famous
dream of the August night.</p>

<p>"What do these people want?" I asked myself.
"Where have I been brought? How shall I get out
of this?" I felt almost a sense of fear, and looked
around uneasily. Little by little I began to understand.</p>

<p>"I have a sore on my shoulder," said one; "I
cannot work; give me a penny."</p>

<p>"I have a broken leg," said another.</p>

<p>"I have a palsied arm."</p>

<p>"I have had a long sickness."</p>

<p>"<i>Un cuarto, SeÃ±orito!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Un real, caballero!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Una peseta para todos!</i>"</p>

<p>This last request was received with a general cry
of approval: "<i>Una peseta para todos!</i>" (a <i>peseta</i> for
us all).</p>

<p>With some little trepidation I drew out my purse;
they all stood on tiptoe; the nearest poked their
chins into it; those behind put their chins on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
heads of those in front; the farthest stretched out
their arms.</p>

<p>"One moment," I cried. "Who has the most
authority among you all?"</p>

<p>They all replied with one voice, stretching out
their arms toward the same person, "That one."</p>

<p>It was a terrible old hag, all nose and chin, with a
great tuft of white hair standing straight above her
head like a bunch of feathers, and a mouth which
seemed like a letter-box, with little clothing save a
chemise&mdash;black, shrivelled, and mummified; she approached
me bowing and smiling, and held out her
hands to take mine.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I demanded, taking a step
backward.</p>

<p>"Your fortune," they all cried.</p>

<p>"Tell my fortune, then," I replied, holding out my
hand.</p>

<p>The old woman took my poor hand between her
ten&mdash;I cannot say fingers, but shapeless bones&mdash;placed
her sharp nose on it, raised her head, looked
hard at me, pointed her finger toward me, and,
swaying and pausing at every sentence as if she
were reciting poetry, said to me in inspired accents,
"Thou wert born upon a famous day.</p>

<p>"Upon a famous day also shalt thou die.</p>

<p>"Thou art the possessor of amazing riches."</p>

<p>Here she muttered I know not what about sweethearts
and marriage and felicity, from which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
understood that she supposed I was married, and
then she continued: "On the day of thy marriage
there was great feasting in thy house; there were
many to give and take.</p>

<p>"And another woman wept.</p>

<p>"And when thou seest her the wings of thy heart
open."</p>

<p>And so on in this strain, saying that I had sweethearts
and friends and treasures and jewels in store
for me every day of the year, in every country of
the world. While the old woman was speaking
they were all silent, as if they believed she had
prophesied truly. She finally closed her prophecy
with a formula of dismissal, and ended the formula
by extending her arms and making a skip in a dancing
attitude. I gave her the peseta, and the crowd
broke into shouting, applause, and singing, making
a thousand uncanny hops and gestures around me,
saluting me with nudges and slaps of the hand on
my back, as if I were an old friend, until finally, by
dint of wriggling and striking now one and then
another, I succeeded in opening a passage and rejoined
my friends. But a new danger threatened
us. The news of the arrival of a foreigner had
spread, the tribes were in motion, the city of the
gypsies was all in an uproar; from the neighboring
houses and from the distant huts, from the top of the
hill and the bottom of the valley, ran boys, women
with babies about their necks, old men with canes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
cripples, and professional imposters, septuagenarian
prophetesses who wished to tell my fortune&mdash;an
army of beggars coming upon us from every direction.
It was night; there was no time for hesitation;
we broke into a run toward the city like
school-boys. Then a devilish cry broke out behind
us, and the nimblest began to chase us. Thanks to
Heaven! after a short race we found ourselves in
safety&mdash;tired and breathless, and covered with dust,
but safe.</p>

<p>"It was necessary to escape at any cost," said
SeÃ±or Melchiorre with a laugh; "otherwise we
should have gone home without our shirts."</p>

<p>"And take notice," added Gongora, "that we
have seen only the door of Gypsy-town, the civilized
part, not the Paris nor the Madrid, but at least
the Granada, of the Albaicin. If we could only have
gone on! if you could have seen the rest!"</p>

<p>"But how many thousand are there of those
people?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"No one knows."</p>

<p>"How do they live?"</p>

<p>"No one can imagine."</p>

<p>"What authority do they recognize?"</p>

<p>"One only&mdash;<i>los reyes</i> (the kings), the heads of families
or of houses, those who have the most money
and years. They never go out of their city; they
know nothing, they live in the dark as to all that
happens beyond the circle of their hovels. Dy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>nasties
fall, governments change, armies clash, and
it is a miracle if the news ever reaches their ears.
Ask them if Isabella is still on the throne; they do
not know. Ask them who Amadeus is; they have
never heard his name. They are born and perish
like flies, and they live as they lived centuries ago,
multiplying without leaving their own boundaries,
ignorant and unknown, seeing nothing all their
lives beyond the valleys lying below their feet and
the Alhambra towering above their heads."</p>

<p>We passed again through all the streets that we
had traversed, now dark and deserted, and endless
as it seemed to me; and, climbing and descending,
turning and twisting, and turning again, we finally
arrived at the square of the Audiencia in the middle
of the city of Granada&mdash;in the civilized world. At
the sight of the brightly-lighted cafÃ©s and shops I
experienced a feeling of pleasure, as if I had just
returned to city-life after a year's sojourn in an
uninhabited wilderness.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day I left for Valencia.
I remember that a few moments before starting, as I
was paying my hotel-bill, I observed to the proprietor
that there was an overcharge for one candle,
and playfully asked him, "Will you deduct it for
me?" The proprietor seized his pen, and, deducting
twenty centimes from the total charge, replied
in a voice which he wished to appear emotional,
"The devil! among Italians!"</p>

<h2><a name="VALENCIA" id="VALENCIA"></a>VALENCIA.</h2>


<p>The journey from Granada to Valencia, made all
<i>de un tiron</i> (at one breath), as they say in Spain, is
one of those recreations in which a rational man
indulges only once in his life. From Granada to
Menjibar, a village on the left bank of the Guadalquivir,
between Jaen and Andujar, is a night's
ride by diligence; from Menjibar to the Alcazar de
San Juan is a half-day's journey by railway in an
uncurtained carriage, through a plain as bare as the
palm of one's hand, under a blazing sun; and from
the Alcazar de San Juan to Valencia, taking account
of an entire evening spent in the station of the Alcazar,
makes another night and another morning
before one reaches the longed-for city at noon,
where Nature, as Emile Praga would say, is horrified
at the dreadful idea that there are still four
months of summer.</p>

<p>But it must be said that the country through
which one passes is so beautiful from beginning to
the end that if one were capable of appreciation
when one is dead with sleep and finds one's self
turning into water by reason of the heat, one would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
go into ecstasies a thousand times. It is a journey
of unexpected landscapes, sudden vistas, remarkable
contrasts, theatrical effects of Nature, so to speak&mdash;marvellous
and fantastic transformations, which leave
in the mind an indescribable, vague illusion of having
passed not through a part of Spain, but along an
entire meridian of the earth across the most dissimilar
countries. From the <i>vega</i> of Granada, which
you cross in the moonlight, almost opening a way
among the groves and gardens, in the midst of a
luxuriant vegetation that seems to crowd around
you like a tossing sea, ready to overflow and engulf
you with its billows of verdure,&mdash;from this you
emerge into the midst of ragged and precipitous
mountains, where not a trace of human habitation
is to be seen; you graze the edge of precipices, wind
along the banks of mountain-torrents, run along at
the bottom of the ravines, and seem to be lost in a
rocky labyrinth. Then you come out a second time
among the green hills and flowery fields of upper
Andalusia, and then, all suddenly, the fields and hills
disappear and you find yourself in the midst of the
rocky mountains of the Sierra Morena, that hang
over your head from every direction and close the
horizon all around like the walls of an immense
abyss. You leave the Sierra Morena, and the desert
plains of La Mancha stretch before you; you leave
La Mancha and advance through the flowery plain
of Almansa, varied by every sort of cultivation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
presenting the appearance of a vast carpet of checkered
pattern colored in all the shades of green that
can be found upon the pallet of a landscape-painter.
And, finally, the plain of Almansa opens into a delightful
oasis, a land blest of God, a true earthly
paradise, the kingdom of Valencia, from whose
boundaries, even to the city itself, you pass through
gardens, vineyards, fragrant orange-groves, white
villas encircled by terraces, cheerful, brightly-colored
villages, clusters, avenues, and groves of palms,
pomegranates, aloes, and sugar-canes, interminable
hedges of Indian fig, long chains of low hills, and
conical mounds cultivated as kitchen-gardens and
flower-beds, laid out with minute care from top to
bottom, and variegated like great bunches of grass
and flowers; and everywhere a vigorous vegetation
which hides every bare spot, covers every height,
clothes every projection, climbs, falls, trails along,
marches forward, overflows, intertwines, shuts off
the view, impedes the road, dazzles with its verdure,
wearies with its beauty, confounds with its caprices
and its frolics, and produces an effect as of a sudden
parting of the earth raised to fever heat by the fires
of a secret volcano.</p>

<p>The first building which meets the eye on entering
Valencia is an immense bull-ring situated to the right
of the railway. The building consists of four orders
of superimposed arches rising on stout pilasters, all
of brick, and in the distance resembling the Colos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>seum.
It is the bull-ring where on the fourth of
September, 1871, King Amadeus, in the presence of
thousands of spectators, shook hands with Tato, the
celebrated one-legged <i>torero</i>, who as director of the
spectacle had asked permission to render his homage
in the royal box. Valencia is full of mementos of
the duke d'Aosta. The sacristan of the cathedral
has in his possession a gold chronometer bearing the
duke's initials in diamonds, with a chain of pearls,
which was presented by him when he went to pray
in the chapel of Our Lady of the Desolate. In the
hospice of the same name the poor remember that
one day they received their daily bread from his
hand. In the mosaic workshop of one Nolla they
preserve two bricks, upon one of which he cut his
own name with his sword, and upon the other the
name of the queen. In the Plaza di Tetuan the
people point out the house of Count di Cervellon,
where he was entertained; it is the same house in
which Ferdinand VII. signed the decrees annulling
the constitution in 1814, in which Queen Christina
abdicated the throne in 1840, in which Queen Isabella
spent some days in 1858. In short, there is
not a corner of the city of which it cannot be said,
Here he shook hands with a working-man, here he
visited a factory, there he passed on foot far from
his suite, surrounded by a crowd, trustful, serene,
and smiling.</p>

<p>It was in Valencia, since I am speaking of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
duke d'Aosta,&mdash;it was in the city of Valencia that
a little girl of five years in reciting some verses
touched upon that terrible subject of a <i>foreign king</i>
with probably the noblest and most considerate
words spoken in Spain for many years previous to
that time&mdash;words which, if all Spain had remembered
and pondered then, would perhaps have spared
her many of those calamities which have befallen
her, and others which still threaten; words which
perhaps one day some Spaniard may repeat with a
sigh, and which already at this time draw from
events a marvellous light of truth and beauty. And,
since these verses are graceful and simple, I transcribe
them here. The poem is entitled "God and
the King," and runs as follows:</p>

<p>"God, Ruler over all, created mortals one day,
and made all equal with His mighty hand. He recognized
neither nations nor colors nor divisions, and
to behold men happy was His desire. The king,
who is His image, ought to imitate His goodness,
and the people have no need to ask whether he be
German or French. Why, then, with angry frown
repulse him if he be good? A king abounding
in good deeds holds the world as his country.
Charles V., the emperor, came from a foreign na<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>tion,
and by his valor won a thousand laurels for
Spain. And the fortunate reign of Philip the Courageous
is a glorious memory even though founded
upon war.</p>

<p>"To-day a third king rules you born on a foreign
soil, who comes to look upon our sky, a clear spark
of God. His love is true and just and loyal to the
light of our sun, and this is a good and liberal king
Spanish people adore. And around your brows
you shall wear the trophy of perpetual glory upon
which history shall write, 'Great was King Amadeus.'"</p>

<p>Oh, poor little girl! how many wise things you
have said! and how many foolish things others have
done!</p>

<p>The city of Valencia, if one enters it with one's
mind full of the ballads in which the poets sang of
its marvels, does not seem to correspond to the
lovely image formed of it; neither, on the other
hand, does it offer that sinister appearance for which
one is prepared if one considers its just fame as a
turbulent, warlike city, the fomenter of civil strife&mdash;a
city prouder of the smell of its powder than of the
fragrance of its orange-groves. It is a city built in
the midst of a vast flowery plain on the right bank
of the Guadalquivir, which separates it from the
suburbs, a little way from the roadstead which serves
as a port, and consists all of tortuous streets lined
with high, ungainly, many-colored houses, and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
this account less pleasing in appearance than the
streets of the Andalusian cities, and entirely devoid
of that evasive Oriental grace which so strangely
stirs one's fancy. Along the left bank of the river
extends a magnificent promenade formed of majestic
avenues and beautiful gardens. These one reaches
by going out of the city through the gate of the
Cid, a structure flanked by two great embattled
towers named after the hero because he passed
through it in 1094 after he had expelled the Moors
from Valencia. The cathedral, built upon the spot
where stood a temple of Diana in Roman times, then
a church of San Salvador in the time of the Goths,
then a mosque in Moorish times, afterward converted
into a church by the Cid, changed a second
time into a mosque by the Moors in 1101, and
for the third time into a church by King Don
Jayme after the final overthrow of the invaders,
is a vast structure, exceedingly rich in ornaments
and treasures, but it cannot bear comparison with
the greater number of the other Spanish cathedrals.
There are a few palaces worth seeing, besides the
palace of the Audiencia, a beautiful monument of
the sixteenth century in which the Cortes of the
kingdom of Valencia assembled; the <i>Casa de Ayuntamiento</i>,
built between the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, in which are preserved the sword of Don
Jayme, the keys of the city, and the banner of the
Moors; and, above all, <i>the Lonja</i>&mdash;the Bourse of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
merchants&mdash;notable for its celebrated hall consisting
of three great naves divided by twenty-four spiral
columns, above which curve the light arches of the
vaulted roof in bold lines, the architecture imparting
to the eye a pleasing impression of gayety and harmony.
And, finally, there is the art-gallery, which
is not one of the least in Spain.</p>

<p>But, to tell the truth, in those few days that I remained
at Valencia waiting for the boat I was more
occupied by politics than by art. And I proved the
truth of the words I heard an illustrious Italian say
before I left Italy&mdash;one who knew Spain like his
his own home: "The foreigner who lives even for a
short time in Spain is drawn little by little, almost
insensibly, to heat his blood and muddle his brain
over politics, as if Spain were his own country or
as if the fortunes of his country were depending
upon those of Spain. The passions are so inflamed,
the struggle is so furious, and in this struggle there
is always so clearly at stake the future, the safety,
and the life of the nation, that it is impossible for
any one with the least tinge of the Latin blood in his
imagination and his system to remain an indifferent
spectator. You must needs grow excited, speak at
party meetings, take the elections seriously, mingle
with the crowd at the political demonstrations, break
with your friends, form a clique of those who think
as you think&mdash;make, in a word, a Spaniard of yourself,
even to the whites of your eyes. And gradu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>ally,
as you become Spanish, you forget Europe, as
if it were at the antipodes, and end in seeing nothing
beyond Spain, as if you were governing it, and as if
all its interests were in your hands."</p>

<p>Such is the case, and this was my experience. In
those few days the Conservative ministry was shipwrecked
and the Radicals had the wind behind
them. Spain was all in a ferment; governors, generals,
officials of all grades and of all administrations
fell; a crowd of parvenus burst into the offices
of the ministry with cries of joy: Zorilla was to inaugurate
a new era of prosperity and peace; Don
Amadeus had had an inspiration from heaven; liberty
had conquered; Spain was saved. And I, as I
listened to the band playing in front of the new governor's
mansion under a clear starry sky in the
midst of a joyous crowd,&mdash;I too had a ray of hope
that the throne of Don Amadeus might finally extend
its roots, and reproached myself for being too
prone to predict evil. And that comedy which
Zorilla played at his villa when he would by no
means accept the presidency of the ministry, and
sent back his friends and the members of the deputation,
and finally, tired of continually saying no,
fell into a swoon on saying yes, this, I say, gave
me at the time a high opinion of the firmness of his
character and led me to augur happily for the new
government. And I said to myself that it was a sin
to leave Spain just when the horizon was clearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
and the royal palace of Madrid was tinted rose-color.
And I had already considered the plan of returning
to Madrid that I might have the satisfaction of sending
some consoling news to Italy, and so be pardoned
for the imprudence of sending unvarnished accounts
of the situation up to that time. And I repeated
the verses of Prati:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Oh qual destin t'aspetta</div>
  <div class="verse">Aquila giovenetta!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(Oh what a destiny awaits thee, young eagle!)
And, save a little bombast in the appellation, it
seemed to me that they contained a prophecy, and
I imagined meeting the poet in the Piazza Colonna
at Rome and running toward him to offer my congratulations
and press his hand....</p>

<p>The most beautiful sight in Valencia is the market.
The Valencian peasants are the most artistic
and bizarre in their dress of all the peasants of
Spain. To cut a good figure in a group of maskers
at one of our masquerades they need only enter the
theatre dressed as they would be on a festival or
market-day in the streets of Valencia and along
the country roads. On first seeing them dressed in
this style, one laughs, and cannot in any way be
brought to believe that they are Spanish peasants.
They have an indescribable air of Greeks, Bedouins,
buffoons, tightrope-walkers, women partly undressed
on their way to bed, the silent characters of a play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
not quite ready to make their appearance, or facetious
people who wish to make themselves generally
ridiculous. They wear a full white shirt that takes
the place of a jacket; a parti-colored velvet waistcoat
open at the breast; a pair of zouave linen
breeches which do not reach the knee, looking like
drawers and standing out like the skirts of a ballet-dancer;
a red or blue sash around the waist; a sort
of embroidered white woollen stockings that leave
the knee bare; a pair of corded sandals like those
of the Catalan peasants; and on their heads, which
are almost all shaved like those of the Chinese,
they wear a handkerchief, red, sky-blue, yellow,
or white, bound around like a cornucopia, and
knotted at the temples or at the nape of the neck.
They sometimes wear small velvet hats similar in
shape to those worn in the other provinces of Spain.
When they go into the city they nearly all carry
around their shoulders or on their arms, now like a
shawl, now like a mantle, or again like a little cape,
a woollen <i>capa</i>, long and narrow, in brightly-colored
stripes in which white and red predominate, adorned
with fringe and rosettes. One may easily imagine
the appearance presented by a square where there
are gathered some hundreds of men dressed after
this fashion: it is a Carnival scene, a festival, a tumult
of colors, that makes one feel as gay as a band
of music; a spectacle at once clownish, pretty, imposing,
and ridiculous, to which the haughty faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
and the majestic bearing which distinguish the Valencian
peasants add an air of gravity which heightens
the extraordinary beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>If there is an insolent, lying proverb, it is that
old Spanish one which says, "In Valencia flesh is
grass, grass is water, men are women, and the
women nothing." Leaving that part about the flesh
and the grass, which is a pun, the men, especially
those of the lower classes, are tall and robust, and
have the bold appearance of the Catalans and Arragonese,
with a livelier and more luminous expression
of the eye; and the women, by the consent of all
the Spaniards and of as many foreigners as have
travelled in Spain, are the most classically beautiful
in the country. The Valencians, who know that the
eastern coast of the Peninsula was originally settled
by Greeks and Carthaginians, say, "It is a clear
case. The Grecian type of beauty has lingered
here." I do not venture to say yes or no to this
assertion, for to describe the beauty of the women
of a city where one has passed only a few hours
would seem to me like a license to be taken only by
the compiler of a "Guide." But one can easily discover
a decided difference between the Andalusian
and Valencian types of beauty. The Valencian is
taller, more robust, and fairer, with more regular
features, gentler eyes, and a more matronly walk
and carriage. She does not possess the bewitching
air of the Andalusian, which makes it necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
bite one's finger as if to subdue the sudden and
alarming insurrection of one's capricious desires at
sight of her; but the Valencian is a woman whom
one regards with a feeling of calmer admiration, and
while one looks one says, as La Harpe said of the
Apollo Belvidere, "<i>Notre tete se releve, notre maintien
s'ennoblit</i>," and instead of imagining a little Andalusian
house to hide her from the eyes of the
world, one longs for a marble palace to receive the
ladies and cavaliers who will come to render her
homage.</p>

<p>If one is to believe the rest of the Spaniards, the
Valencian people are fierce and cruel beyond all imagination.
If one wishes to get rid of an enemy, he
finds an obliging man who for a few crowns undertakes
the business with as much indifference as he
would accept a commission to carry a letter to the
post. A Valencian peasant who finds that he has a
gun in his hands as he passes an unknown man in a
lonely street says to his companion, "See if I can
aim straight?" and takes aim and fires. This actually
occurred not many years ago: I was assured
of its truth. In the cities and villages of Spain the
boys and young men of the people are accustomed
to play at being bulls, as they call it. One takes the
place of the bull and does the butting; another,
with a sharp stick under his arm like a lance, climbs
on the back of a third, who represents the horse, and
repulses the assaults of the first. Once a band of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
young Valencians thought they would introduce
some innovations into this sport, and so make it
seem a little more realistic and afford the spectators
and the participants a little more amusement
than the customary way of playing it; and the innovations
were to substitute for the stick a long
sharp-pointed knife, one of those formidable <i>navajas</i>
that we saw at Seville, and to give the man who took
the part of the bull two other shorter knives, which,
fastened firmly on either side of his head, answered
the purpose of horns. It seems incredible, but it is
true. They played with the knives, shed a sea of
blood, several were killed, some were mortally
wounded, and others badly hurt, without the game
becoming a fight, without the rules of the sport
being transgressed, and without any one raising his
voice to end the slaughter.</p>

<p>I tell these things as they were told to me,
although I am far from believing all that is said
against the Valencians; but it is certain that at Valencia
the public safety, if not a myth, as our papers
poetically say in speaking of Romagna and Sicily, is
certainly not the first of the good things which one
enjoys after the blessing of life. I was persuaded
of this fact the first evening of my stay in the city.
I did not know the way to the port, but thought I
was near it, and asked a shop-woman which way I
should take. She uttered a cry of astonishment:</p>

<p>"Do you wish to go to the port, <i>caballero</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<i>Ave Maria purissima!</i> to the port at this hour?"</p>

<p>And she turned toward a group of women who
were standing by the door, and said to them in the
Valencian dialect, "Women, do you answer for me:
this gentleman is asking me the way to the port!"</p>

<p>The women replied in one voice, "God save him!"</p>

<p>"But from what?"</p>

<p>"Don't risk yourself, sir."</p>

<p>"What is your reason?"</p>

<p>"A thousand reasons."</p>

<p>"Tell me one of them?"</p>

<p>"You would be murdered."</p>

<p>One reason was enough for me, as any one can imagine,
and I did not go to the port.</p>

<p>For the rest, at Valencia as elsewhere, in whatever
intercourse I had with the people I met only with
courtesy as a foreigner and as an Italian&mdash;a friendly
welcome even among those who would not hear
foreign kings discussed in general, and princes of
the house of Savoy in particular, and such men were
numerous, but they were courteous enough to say at
once, "Let us not harp on that string." To a foreigner
who, when asked whence he comes, replies, "I am
a Frenchman," they respond with an agreeable smile,
as if to say, "We recognize each other." To one
who answers, "I am a German or an Englishman,"
they make a slight inclination of the head, which
implies, "I bow to you;" but when one replies, "I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
am an Italian," they eagerly extend the hand as if
to say, "We are friends;" and they look at one with
an air of curiosity, as you look for the first time at a
person who is said to resemble you, and they smile
pleasantly on hearing the Italian tongue, as you
would smile on hearing some one, though in no
mocking spirit, imitate your voice and accents. In
no country in the world does an Italian feel nearer
home than in Spain. The sky, the speech, the
faces, and the dress remind him of his fatherland;
the veneration with which the Spanish pronounce
the names of our great poets and our great painters,
that vague and pleasing sense of curiosity with
which they speak of our famous cities, the enthusiasm
with which they cultivate our music, the impulsiveness
of their affections, the fire of their language,
the rhythms of their poetry, the eyes of their women,
the air and the sun,&mdash;oh! an Italian must be without
a spark of love for his fatherland who does not feel
an emotion of sympathy for this country, who does
not feel inclined to excuse its errors, who does not
sincerely deplore its misfortunes, who does not desire
for it a happy future. O beautiful hills of Valencia,
smiling banks of the Guadalquivir, charmed
gardens of Granada, little white cottages of Seville,
proud towers of Toledo, roaring streets of Madrid,
and venerable walls of Saragossa! and you, kindly
hosts and courteous companions of my travels&mdash;you
who have spoken to me of Italy as of a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
fatherland, who with your festal gayety have scattered
my restless melancholy!&mdash;I shall always carry
deep down in my heart a feeling of gratitude and
love for you, and I shall cherish your images in my
memory, as one of the dearest recollections of my
youth, and shall always think of you as one of the
loveliest dreams of my life.</p>

<p>I repeated these words to myself at midnight as
I looked over brightly-lighted Valencia, leaning
against the rail of the good ship <i>Xenil</i>, which was
on the point of sailing. Some young Spaniards had
come on board with me. They were going to
Marseilles to take ship from that port to the Antilles,
where they expected to remain for some years. One
of them stood alone weeping; suddenly he raised his
head and looked toward the shore between two anchored
vessels, and exclaimed in a tone of desolation,
"Oh, my God! I hoped she would not come!"</p>

<p>In a few moments a boat approached the ship; a
little white figure, followed by a man enveloped in a
cloak, hastily climbed the ladder, and with a deep
sob threw herself into the arms of the young man,
who had run to meet her.</p>

<p>At that moment the boatswain called, "All off,
gentlemen!"</p>

<p>Then there followed a most distressing scene: the
two young persons were torn apart, and the young
lady was borne almost fainting to the boat, which
pushed off a little and remained motionless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>The ship started.</p>

<p>The young man dashed madly forward toward the
rail, and, sobbing, cried in a voice that pierced one's
heart, "Adieu, darling! adieu! adieu!"</p>

<p>The little white figure stretched out her arms and
perhaps responded, but her voice was not heard.
The boat was dropped behind and disappeared.</p>

<p>One of the young men said to me in a whisper,
"They are betrothed."</p>

<p>It was a lovely night, but sad. Valencia was soon
lost to view, and I thought I should never see Spain
again, and wept.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
